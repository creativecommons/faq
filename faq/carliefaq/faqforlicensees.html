<h3 id="before-using-cc-licensed-material">Before using CC-licensed material</h3>
<h4 id="what-should-i-think-about-before-using-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license">What should I think about before using material offered under a Creative Commons license?</h4>
<p>CC offers <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">six core licenses</a>, each of which grants a different set of permissions. Before you use CC-licensed material, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/">you should review the terms of the particular license</a> to be sure your anticipated use is permitted. If you wish to use the work in a manner that is not permitted by the license, you should contact the rights holder (often the creator) to get permission first, or look for an alternative work that is licensed in a way that permits your anticipated use. Note that if you use material in a way that is not permitted by the applicable license and your use is not otherwise permitted by an applicable copyright exception or limitation, the license is <a href="#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back" title="wikilink">automatically terminated</a> and you may be liable for copyright infringement, even if you are eligible to have your rights reinstated later.</p>
<p>Before using material offered under a Creative Commons license, you should know that <a href="#does-a-creative-commons-license-give-me-all-the-rights-i-need-to-use-the-work" title="wikilink">CC licenses only grant permissions needed under copyright and similar rights</a>, and there may be additional rights you need to use it as intended. You should also understand that licensors do not offer warranties or guarantees about the material they are licensing unless expressly indicated otherwise. All materials are licensed &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and a disclaimer of warranties applies unless expressly provided otherwise. If you want to ask for a warranty or guarantee about rights to use the material, you should talk with the licensor before using it.</p>
<p><span id="Does_using_a_Creative_Commons-licensed_work_give_me_all_the_rights_I_need"></span></p>


<h4 id="does-a-creative-commons-license-give-me-all-the-rights-i-need-to-use-the-work">Does a Creative Commons license give me all the rights I need to use the work?</h4>
<p>It depends. CC licenses do not license rights other than copyright and <a href="#can-i-use-cc-licenses-to-license-rights-other-than-copyright" title="wikilink">similar rights</a> (which include <a href="#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights" title="wikilink">sui generis database rights</a> in version 4.0). For example, they do not license trademark or patent rights, or the <a href="#what-are-publicity-personality-and-privacy-rights" title="wikilink">publicity, personality, and privacy rights</a> of third parties. However, licensors agree to waive or not assert any <a href="#what-are-moral-rights" title="wikilink">moral rights</a>, publicity rights, personality rights, or privacy rights they themselves hold, to the limited extent necessary to allow exercise of the licensed rights. Any rights outside of the scope of the license may require clearance (i.e., permission) in order to use the work as you would like.</p>
<p>Additionally, creative works sometimes incorporate works owned by others (known as &ldquo;third party content&rdquo;), often used pursuant to a CC license or under an exception or limitation to copyright such as fair use in the U.S. You should make sure you have permission to use any third party content contained in the work you want to use, or that your use is otherwise allowed under the laws of your jurisdiction, particularly in cases such as fair use where your right to use the content depends on the particular context in which you plan to use it.</p>
<p>All CC licenses contain a disclaimer of warranties, meaning that the licensor is not guaranteeing anything about the work, including whether she owns the copyright, has received permission to include third-party content within her work, or secured other rights such as through the use of model releases if a person&rsquo;s image is used in the work. You <a href="#can-creative-commons-give-legal-advice-about-its-licenses-or-other-tools-or-help-with-cc-license-enforcement" title="wikilink">may wish to obtain legal advice</a> before using CC-licensed material if you are not sure whether you have all the rights you need.</p>


<h4 id="what-if-there-are-sui-generis-database-rights-that-apply-to-my-use-of-a-cc-licensed-database">What if there are sui generis database rights that apply to my use of a CC-licensed database?</h4>
<p>In the somewhat limited circumstances where sui generis database rights apply to your use, special conditions apply and there are more specific considerations you should be aware of. Under 4.0, sui generis database rights are licensed alongside copyright, but the treatment in earlier versions of the license varies. A fuller explanation of these variations and related considerations is available in the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/data" title="wikilink">Data FAQ</a>.</p>


<h4 id="where-can-i-find-material-offered-under-a-cc-license">Where can I find material offered under a CC license?</h4>
<p>If you are looking for material offered under a Creative Commons license, <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">CC Search</a> is a good starting point. There is also a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Content_Directories" title="wikilink">directory</a> of organizations and individuals who use CC licenses. Some media sites, such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, have search filters for material licensed using CC&rsquo;s licenses.</p>
<p>Be sure to confirm that the material you want to use is actually under a CC license, as search results may sometimes be misleading.</p>
<p><span id="So_I_don.E2.80.99t_have_to_pay_to_use_Creative_Commons-licensed_works_if_I_comply_with_the_license_terms"></span></p>


<h4 id="are-creative-commons-works-really-free-to-use">Are Creative Commons works really free to use?</h4>
<p>Yes. While many if not most CC-licensed works are available at no cost, some licensors charge for initial access to CC-licensed works&mdash;for example, by publishing CC-licensed content only to subscribers, or by charging for downloads. However, even if you have paid an access charge, once you have a copy of CC-licensed material, you may make any further uses permitted by the license without paying licensing fees.</p>
<p>(If you wish to make uses that are not permitted by the license&mdash;for example, making a <a href="#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses" title="wikilink">commercial use</a> of an NC-licensed photo&mdash;the licensor may charge for those additional rights.)</p>


<h4 id="what-should-i-know-about-differences-between-the-international-licenses-and-the-ported-licenses">What should I know about differences between the international licenses and the ported licenses?</h4>
<p>As a licensee, you should always read and understand the relevant license&rsquo;s legal code before using CC-licensed material, particularly if you are using material that is licensed using a <a href="#what-are-the-international-unported-creative-commons-licenses-and-why-does-cc-offer-ported-licenses" title="wikilink">ported license</a> with which you are unfamiliar. Our porting process involved adapting the international licenses to the legal framework of different jurisdictions, and in that process slight adjustments may have been made that you should make yourself aware of in advance of using the material. You can find more information about the ported licenses in the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction_Database" title="wikilink">Jurisdiction Database</a>.</p>
<p>There are currently no ported versions of 4.0, and we expect there will be few, if any, in the future. All official translations of the 4.0 international licenses are equivalent: you may substitute one for another depending on your preferred language.</p>
<p>However, the ported versions of 3.0 and earlier sometimes contain small differences from the international license depending on the ways in which they have been adapted to their jurisdictions. For example, a handful of the ported licenses contain provisions specifying which laws will apply in the event the licensor chooses to enforce the license, and a few of the ported licenses contain forum selection clauses.</p>


<h3 id="general-license-compliance">General license compliance</h3>

<h4 id="what-happens-if-i-want-to-use-the-material-in-a-way-that-is-not-permitted-by-the-license">What happens if I want to use the material in a way that is not permitted by the license?</h4>
<p>Contact the rights holders to ask for permission. Otherwise, <a href="#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions" title="wikilink">unless an exception or limitation to copyright applies</a>, your use of the material may violate the Creative Commons license. If you violate the terms of the license, your rights to use the material will be <a href="#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back" title="wikilink">automatically terminated</a>, and you may be liable for copyright infringement.</p>


<h4 id="do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions">Do I always have to comply with the license terms? If not, what are the exceptions?</h4>
<p>You need to comply with the license terms if what you are doing would otherwise require permission from the rights holder. If your use would not require permission from the rights holder because it falls under an exception or limitation, such as fair use, or because the material has come into the public domain, the license does not apply, and you do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. Additionally, if you are using an excerpt small enough to be uncopyrightable, the license does not apply to your use, and you do not need to comply with its terms.</p>
<p>However, if you are using excerpts of CC-licensed material which individually are minimal and do not require license compliance, but together make up a significant copyrightable chunk, you must comply with the license terms. For example, if you quote many individual lines from a poem across several sections of a blog post, and your use is not a fair use, you must comply with the license even though no individual line would have been a substantial enough portion of the work to require this.</p>


<h3 id="attribution">Attribution</h3>

<h4 id="how-do-i-properly-attribute-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license">How do I properly attribute material offered under a Creative Commons license?</h4>
<p>All CC licenses require users to attribute the creator of licensed material, unless the creator has <a href="#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions" title="wikilink">waived that requirement</a>, not supplied a name, or <a href="#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it" title="wikilink">asked that her name be removed</a>. Additionally, you must retain a copyright notice, a link to the license (or to the deed), a license notice, a notice about the disclaimer of warranties, and a URI if reasonable. For versions prior to 4.0, you must also provide the title of the work. (Though it is not a requirement in 4.0, it is still recommended if one is supplied.)</p>
<p>You must also indicate if you have <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Modifications_and_adaptations_must_be_indicated" title="wikilink">modified the work</a>&mdash;for example, if you have taken an excerpt, or cropped a photo. (For versions prior to 4.0, this is only required if you have created an adaptation by contributing your own creative material, but it is recommended even when not required.) It is not necessary to note trivial alterations, such as correcting a typo or changing a font size. Finally, you must retain an indication of previous modifications to the work.</p>
<p>CC licenses have a flexible attribution requirement, so there is not necessarily one correct way to provide attribution. The proper method for giving credit will depend on the medium and means you are using, and may be implemented in any reasonable manner. Additionally, you may satisfy the attribution requirement by providing a link to a place where the attribution information may be found.</p>
<p>While the attribution requirements in the license are the minimum requirement, we always recommend that you <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution" title="wikilink">follow the best practices</a> for the kind of use you are making. For example, if you are using scientific data marked with CC0, you are not required to give attribution at all, but we recommend that you give the same credit you would give to any other source&mdash;not because the license requires it, but because that is the standard for letting others know the source of the data.</p>
<p>The CC website offers some <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution" title="wikilink">best practices</a> to help you attribute properly, and the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/">CC Australia</a> team has developed a <a href="https://creativecommons.org.au/content/attributingccmaterials.pdf">helpful guide to attributing CC-licensed material (.pdf)</a> in different formats. Note that the attribution and marking requirements vary slightly among license versions. See <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chart" title="wikilink">here for a chart comparing the specific requirements</a>.</p>
<p><span id="Do_I_need_to_be_aware_of_anything_else_when_providing_attribution_or_credit"></span></p>


<h4 id="do-i-need-to-be-aware-of-anything-else-when-providing-attribution">Do I need to be aware of anything else when providing attribution?</h4>
<p>Yes. You need to be careful not to imply any sponsorship, endorsement, or connection with the licensor or attribution party without their permission. Wrongfully implying that a creator, publisher, or anyone else endorses you or your use of a work may be unlawful. Creative Commons makes the obligation not to imply endorsement explicit in its licenses. In addition, if the licensor of a work <a href="#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it" title="wikilink">requests that you remove the identifying credit</a>, you must do so to the extent practical.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you are using a work that is an adaptation of one or more pre-existing works, you may need to <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Noting_third-party_content_in_your_work" title="wikilink">give credit to the creator(s) of the pre-existing work(s)</a>, in addition to giving credit to the creator of the adaptation.</p>


<h4 id="do-i-always-have-to-attribute-the-creator-of-the-licensed-material">Do I always have to attribute the creator of the licensed material?</h4>
<p>You must attribute the creator when you provide material to the public by any means that is restricted by copyright or similar rights. If you are using the material personally but are not making it or any adaptations of it available to others, you do not have to attribute the licensor. Similarly, if you are only distributing the material or adaptations of it within your company or organization, you do not have to comply with the attribution requirement. Learn <a href="#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions" title="wikilink">more</a> about when compliance with the license is not required.</p>


<h3 id="using-licensed-material">Using licensed material</h3>

<h4 id="does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses">Does my use violate the NonCommercial clause of the licenses?</h4>
<p>CC&rsquo;s NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are &ldquo;primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.&rdquo; This is intended to capture the intention of the NC-using community without placing detailed restrictions that are either too broad or too narrow. Please note that CC&rsquo;s definition does not turn on the type of user: if you are a nonprofit or charitable organization, your use of an NC-licensed work could still run afoul of the NC restriction, and if you are a for-profit entity, your use of an NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have violated the term. Whether a use is commercial will depend on the specifics of the situation and the intentions of the user.</p>
<p>In CC&rsquo;s experience, it is usually relatively easy to determine whether a use is permitted, and known conflicts are relatively few considering the popularity of the NC licenses. However, there will always be uses that are challenging to categorize as commercial or noncommercial. CC cannot advise you on what is and is not commercial use. If you are unsure, you should either contact the rights holder for clarification, or search for works that permit commercial uses.</p>
<p>CC has a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation" title="wikilink">brief guide</a> to interpretation of the NC license that goes into more detail about the meaning of the NC license and some key points to pay attention to. Additionally, in 2008, <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Defining_Noncommercial" title="wikilink">Creative Commons published results</a> from a survey on meanings of commercial and noncommercial use generally. Note that the results of the study are not intended to serve as CC&rsquo;s official interpretation of what is and is not commercial use under our licenses, and the results should not be relied upon as such.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it-in-a-different-format">Can I take a CC-licensed work and use it in a different format?</h4>
<p>Yes. When any of the six CC licenses is applied to material, licensees are granted permission to use the material as the license allows, whatever the media or format chosen by the user when it is used or distributed further. This is true even in our NoDerivatives licenses. This is one of a very few default rules established in our licenses, to harmonize what may be different outcomes depending on where CC-licensed material is reused and what jurisdiction&rsquo;s copyright law applies.</p>
<p>This means, for example, that even if a creator distributes a work in digital format, you have permission to print and share a hard copy of the same work.</p>
<p><span id="How_do_I_know_if_a_low-resolution_photo_and_a_high-resolution_photo_are_the_same_work"></span></p>


<h4 id="how-do-i-know-if-a-low-resolution-photo-and-a-high-resolution-photo-are-the-same-work">How do I know if a low-resolution photo and a high-resolution photo are the same work?</h4>
<p>As with most copyright questions, it will depend on applicable law. Generally, to be different works under copyright law, there must be expressive or original choices made that make one work a separate and distinct work from another. The determination depends on the standards for copyright in the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Under U.S. copyright law, for example, mechanical reproduction of a work into a different format <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp">is unlikely to create a separate, new work</a>. Consequently, digitally enhancing or changing the format of a work <em>absent some originality</em>, such as expressive choices made in the enhancement or encoding, will not likely create a separate work for copyright purposes. The creative bar is low, but it is not non-existent. Accordingly, in some jurisdictions releasing a photograph under a CC license will give the public permission to reuse the photograph in a different resolution.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-reuse-an-excerpt-of-a-larger-work-that-is-licensed-with-the-noderivs-restriction">Can I reuse an excerpt of a larger work that is licensed with the NoDerivs restriction?</h4>
<p>The NoDerivs licenses (BY-ND and BY-NC-ND) prohibit reusers from creating adaptations. What constitutes an <a href="#when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation">adaptation</a>, otherwise known as a derivative work, varies slightly based on the law of the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Incorporating an unaltered excerpt from an ND-licensed work into a larger work only creates an adaptation if the larger work can be said to be built upon and derived from the work from which the excerpt was taken. Generally, no derivative work is made of the original from which the excerpt was taken when the excerpt is used to illuminate an idea or provide an example in another larger work. Instead, only the reproduction right of the original copyright holder is being exercised by person reusing the excerpt. All CC licenses grant the right to reproduce a CC-licensed work for noncommercial purposes (at a minimum). For example, a person could make copies of one chapter of an ND-licensed book and not be in violation of the license so long as other conditions of the license are met.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to that general rule, however, when the excerpts are combined with other material in a way that creates some new version of the original from which the excerpt is taken. For example, if a portion of a song was used as part of a new song, that may rise to the level of creating an adaptation of the original song, even though only a portion of it was used and even if that portion was used as-is.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-use-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-when-i-share-cc-licensed-material">Can I use effective technological measures (such as DRM) when I share CC-licensed material?</h4>
<p>No.&nbsp;When you receive material under a Creative Commons license, you may not place additional terms and conditions on the reuse of the work. This includes using effective technological measures (ETMs) that would restrict a licensee&rsquo;s ability to exercise the licensed rights.</p>
<p>A technological measure is considered an ETM if circumventing it carries penalties under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, or similar international agreements. Generally, this means that the anti-circumvention laws of various jurisdictions would cover attempts to break it.</p>
<p>For example, if you remix a CC-licensed song, and you wish to share it on a music site that places digital copy-restriction on all uploaded files, you may not do this without express permission from the licensor. However, if you upload that same file to your own site or any other site that does not apply DRM to the file, and a listener chooses to stream it through an app that applies DRM, you have not violated the license.</p>
<p>Note that merely converting material into a different format that is difficult to access or is only available for certain platforms does not violate the restriction; you may do this without violating the license terms.</p>
<h4 id="can-i-share-cc-licensed-material-on-password-protected-sites">Can I share CC-licensed material on password-protected sites?</h4>
<p>Yes. This is not considered to be a prohibited measure, so long as the protection is merely limiting who may access the content, and does not restrict the authorized recipients from exercising the licensed rights. For example, you may post material under any CC license on a site restricted to members of a certain school, or to paying customers, but <a href="#can-i-use-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-when-i-share-cc-licensed-material" title="wikilink">you may not place effective technological measures (including DRM) on the files</a> that prevents them from sharing the material elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Note that charging for access may not be permitted with NC-licensed material; however, it is not disallowed by the restriction on ETMs.)</p>


<h4 id="can-i-share-cc-licensed-material-on-file-sharing-networks">Can I share CC-licensed material on file-sharing networks?</h4>
<p>Yes. All CC licenses allow redistribution of the unmodified material by any means, including distribution via file-sharing networks. Note that file-trading is expressly considered to be noncommercial for purposes of compliance with the NC licenses. Barter of NC-licensed material for other items of value is not permitted.</p>


<h3 id="additional-restrictions-on-licensed-material">Additional restrictions on licensed material</h3>

<h4 id="what-if-i-received-cc-licensed-material-encumbered-with-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm">What if I received CC-licensed material encumbered with effective technological measures (such as DRM)?</h4>
<p>If you have received material under a CC license that is encumbered with effective technological measures (such as digital rights management or DRM), you may or may not be permitted to break it, depending on the circumstances. By releasing material under a CC license, the licensor agrees not to assert any rights she may have to prevent the circumvention of effective technological measures. (Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, this is implied but not explicit.) However, if she has uploaded it to a site or other distribution channel that itself applies such measures, that site may have the right to prevent you from breaking them, even though the licensor herself cannot do so.</p>
<p>Note that anti-circumvention laws can impose criminal liability in some jurisdictions.</p>


<h4 id="what-if-i-have-received-cc-licensed-material-with-additional-restrictions">What if I have received CC-licensed material with additional restrictions?</h4>
<p>It is possible that CC-licensed material will appear on platforms that impose terms in addition to the copyright license (though <a href="#can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work" title="wikilink">Creative Commons strongly discourages restrictions that interfere with exercise of the licensed rights</a>). These additional terms do not form part of the license for the work. For example, if you download CC-licensed material from a site that does not permit downloading, you may be breaking the terms of use of the site, but you are not infringing the CC license. See our guide to <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Modifying_the_CC_licenses" title="wikilink">Modifying the CC licenses</a> for more guidance and information.</p>


<h3 id="combining-and-adapting-cc-material">Combining and adapting CC material</h3>

<h4 id="when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation">When is my use considered an adaptation?</h4>
<p>Whether a modification of licensed material is considered an <a href="#what-is-an-adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptation</a> for the purpose of CC licenses depends primarily on the applicable copyright law. Copyright law reserves to an original creator the right to create adaptations of the original work. CC licenses that allow for adaptations to be shared&mdash;all except BY-ND and BY-NC-ND&mdash;grant permission to others to create and redistribute adaptations when doing so would otherwise constitute a violation of applicable copyright law. Generally, a modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright law when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable, such as a translation of a novel from one language to another, or the creation of a screenplay based on a novel.</p>
<p>Under CC licenses, synching music in timed relation with a moving image is always considered an adaptation, whether or not it would be considered so under applicable law. Also, under version 4.0, certain uses of databases restricted by sui generis database rights also constitute adaptations (called &ldquo;Adapted Material&rdquo; in the 4.0 licenses), whether or not they would be considered adaptations under copyright law. For more details about adaptations in the database context, see the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/data" title="wikilink">Data FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Note that all CC licenses allow the user to exercise the rights permitted under the license <a href="#can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it-in-a-different-format" title="wikilink">in any format or medium</a>. Those changes are not considered adaptations even if applicable law would suggest otherwise. For example, you may redistribute a book that uses the CC <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license in print form when it was originally distributed online, even if you have had to make formatting changes to do so, as long as you do so in compliance with the other terms of the license.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note on terminology: throughout these FAQs, we use the term &ldquo;remix&rdquo; interchangeably with &ldquo;adapt.&rdquo; Both are designed to mean doing something that constitutes an <a href="#what-is-an-adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptation under copyright law</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><span id="If_I_use_a_Creative_Commons-licensed_work_with_other_works.2C_do_I_have_to_Creative_Commons_license_everything_else_as_well"></span> <span id="Can_I_combine_two_different_Creative_Commons_licensed_works_Can_I_combine_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work_with_another_non-CC_licensed_work"></span> <span id="Can_I_combine_works_that_use_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work"></span></p>


<h4 id="can-i-combine-material-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work">Can I combine material under different Creative Commons licenses in my work?</h4>
<p>It depends. The first question to ask is whether doing so constitutes an <a href="#When_is_my_use_considered_an_adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptation.</a> If the combination does <strong><em>not</em></strong> create an adaptation, then you may combine any CC-licensed content so long as you provide attribution and comply with the NonCommercial restriction if it applies. If you want to combine material in a way that results in the creation of an adaptation (i.e.&nbsp;a &ldquo;remix&rdquo;), then you must pay attention to the particular license that applies to the content you want to combine.</p>
<p>The NoDerivatives licenses do not permit remixing except for private use (the pre-4.0 licenses do not permit remixing at all, except as allowed by exceptions and limitations to copyright). All the other CC licenses allow remixes, but may impose limitations or conditions on how the remix may be used. For example, if you create a remix with material licensed under a ShareAlike license, you need to make sure that all of the material contributed to the remix is licensed under the same license or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses">one that CC has named as compatible</a>, and you must <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution" title="wikilink">properly credit all of the sources</a> with the <a href="#how-do-i-properly-attribute-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license" title="wikilink">required attribution</a> and license information. Similarly, if you want to use a remix for <a href="#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses" title="wikilink">commercial purposes</a>, you cannot incorporate material released under one of the NonCommercial licenses.</p>
<p>The chart below shows which CC-licensed material can be remixed. To use the chart, find a license on the left column and on the top right row. If there is a check mark in the box where that row and column intersect, then the works can be remixed. If there is an &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the box, then the works may not be remixed unless an exception or limitation applies. See <a href="#if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use" title="wikilink">below for details on how remixes may be licensed</a>.</p>

<h4 id="if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use">If I derive or adapt material offered under a Creative Commons license, which CC license(s) can I use?</h4>
<p>If you make <a href="#When_is_my_use_considered_an_adaptation" title="wikilink">adaptations</a> of material under a CC license (i.e.&nbsp;&ldquo;remix&rdquo;), the original CC license always applies to the material you are adapting even once adapted. The license you may choose for your own contribution (called your &ldquo;adapter&rsquo;s license&rdquo;) depends on which license applies to the original material. Recipients of the adaptation must comply with both the CC license on the original and your adapter&rsquo;s license.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BY and BY-NC material</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When remixing BY or BY-NC material, it is generally recommended that your adapter&rsquo;s license include at least the same license elements as the license applied to the original material. This eases reuse for downstream users because they are able to satisfy both licenses by complying with the adapter&rsquo;s license. For example, if you adapt material licensed under BY-NC, your adapter&rsquo;s license should also contain the NC restriction. See the chart below for more details.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BY-SA and BY-NC-SA material</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, when remixing ShareAlike content, your adapter&rsquo;s license must be the same license as the license on the material you are adapting. All licenses after version 1.0 also allow you to license your contributions under a later version of the same license, and some also allow ported licenses. (See the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Compatibility_mechanism_in_BY-SA_licenses" title="wikilink">license versions page</a> for details.) If you wish to adapt material under BY-SA or BY-NC-SA and release your contributions under a non-CC license, you should visit the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses">Compatibility page</a> to see which options are allowed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BY-ND and BY-NC-ND material</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The BY-ND and BY-NC-ND licenses do not permit distribution of adaptations (also known as remixes or derivative works), and prohibits the creation of adaptations under the pre-4.0 versions of those licenses. Since you may not share remixes of these materials at all, there is no compatibility with other licenses. (Note that the ND licenses do allow you to reproduce the material in unmodified form together with other material in a collection, as indicated in the next FAQ.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adapter&rsquo;s license chart</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The chart below details the CC license(s) you may use as your adapter&rsquo;s license. When creating an adaptation of material under the license identified in the lefthand column, you may license your contributions to the adaptation under one of the licenses indicated on the top row if the corresponding box is green. CC does not recommend using a license if the corresponding box is yellow, although doing so is technically permitted by the terms of the license. If you do, you should take additional care to mark the adaptation as involving multiple copyrights under different terms so that downstream users are aware of their obligations to comply with the licenses from all rights holders. Dark gray boxes indicate those licenses that you may not use as your adapter&rsquo;s license.</p>

<h3 id="license-termination">License termination</h3>

<h4 id="when-do-creative-commons-licenses-expire">When do Creative Commons licenses expire?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons licenses expire when the underlying copyright and similar rights expire.</p>
<p>Note that the relevant rights may expire at different times. For example, you may have a CC-licensed song where the rights in the musical arrangement expire before the rights in the lyrics. In this case, when the copyright in the music expires, you may use it <a href="#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions" title="wikilink">without being required to comply with the conditions of the CC license</a>; however, you must still comply with the license if you use the lyrics.</p>


<h4 id="what-happens-if-the-author-decides-to-revoke-the-cc-license-to-material-i-am-using">What happens if the author decides to revoke the CC license to material I am using?</h4>
<p>The CC licenses are irrevocable. This means that once you receive material under a CC license, you will always have the right to use it under those license terms, even if the licensor changes his or her mind and stops distributing under the CC license terms. Of course, you may choose to respect the licensor&rsquo;s wishes and stop using the work.</p>


<h4 id="how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back">How can I lose my rights under a Creative Commons license? If that happens, how do I get them back?</h4>
<p>All of the CC licenses terminate if you fail to follow the license conditions. If this happens, you no longer have a license to use the material.</p>
<p>In the 4.0 licenses, your rights under the license are automatically reinstated if you correct this failure within 30 days of discovering the violation (either on your own or because the licensor or someone else has told you). Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, there is no automatic reinstatement.</p>
<p>If you have lost your rights under a CC license and are not entitled to automatic reinstatement, you may regain your rights under the license if the licensor expressly grants you permission. You cannot simply re-download the material to get a new license.</p>
<p>Note that you may still be liable for damages for copyright infringement for the period where you were not in compliance with the license.</p>


<h3 id="technical-questions">Technical Questions</h3>

<h4 id="how-do-creative-commons-licenses-and-public-domain-tools-work-technically">How do Creative Commons licenses and public domain tools work technically?</h4>
<p>The Creative Commons licenses have <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">three layers</a>, as does the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 public domain dedication</a>: the human-readable deed, the lawyer-readable legal code, and the machine-readable metadata. The <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">Public Domain Mark</a> is not legally operative, and so has only two layers: the human-readable mark and machine-readable metadata.</p>
<p>When material is licensed using any of the CC licenses or tools, it is highly recommended that a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads">CC button</a>, text, or other marker somehow accompany it. There are many possible modes for marking. For our licenses, people generally use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose">CC license chooser</a> to generate HTML code that can be pasted into the webpage where the licensed material is published. CC0 and the Public Domain Mark have a separate <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">chooser</a>. Many platforms and web services such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="Drupal" title="wikilink">Drupal</a> support CC licensing directly, allowing you to select an appropriate license. The service then properly marks the work for you.</p>
<p>CC has published some best practices for <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license" title="wikilink">marking</a> your CC-licensed material, and recommends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including a visual indicator (some combination of text and images) that the work is licensed with one of the CC licenses.</li>
<li>Clearly indicating what material is covered under the CC license, especially if it&rsquo;s presented alongside non-licensed materials.</li>
<li>Including a link to the human-readable deed (which itself contains a link to the legal code).</li>
<li>Embedding <a href="#what-does-it-mean-that-creative-commons-licenses-are-machine-readable" title="wikilink">machine-readable</a> metadata in the code of the license indicator or code of the licensed page.</li>

<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-that-creative-commons-licenses-are-machine-readable">What does it mean that Creative Commons licenses are &ldquo;machine-readable&rdquo;?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons has <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL" title="wikilink">specified CC REL</a> as a way to associate machine-readable licensing metadata with objects offered under CC licenses.</p>
<p>Before Creative Commons developed this vocabulary, it was difficult for a machine to ascertain whether an object was marked with a CC license. There was also no standard, predictable place to house metadata about that license (for example, the source URL of the work or the required mode of attribution).</p>
<p>Machine-readable metadata based on well-accepted metadata standards creates a platform upon which new services and applications can be built. Software and services can detect CC licenses and the details of that license, as described by the metadata. For example, on many websites and search engines such as Google and Flickr, you can run filtered searches for works offered under specific CC licenses. In addition, CC license deeds can automatically create copy-and-paste attribution code so users may easily comply with the BY condition of the licenses. When you click on a CC license or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads">button</a> from a page with license metadata, you get copy-and-paste attribution HTML within that license deed page. That HTML is based on available RDFa metadata in the original material.</p>
<p>All HTML provided by the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose">CC license chooser</a> is automatically annotated with <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/metadata" title="wikilink">metadata</a> in <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/RDFa" title="wikilink">RDFa</a> format.</p>
<p><span id="Why_did_Creative_Commons_choose_to_use_the_RDF_format_for_its_metadata"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-is-rdfa">What is RDFa?</h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/RDFa" title="wikilink">RDFa</a> is a method for embedding structured data in a web page. For more information about RDFa, see the following resources:</p>

<h4 id="what-is-cc-rel-and-why-does-creative-commons-recommend-it">What is CC REL and why does Creative Commons recommend it?</h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL">Creative Commons Rights Expression Language</a> (CC REL) renders information about licenses and works machine-readable through standards that define the semantic web. Creative Commons wants to make it easy for creators and scientists to build upon the works of others when they choose; licensing your work for reuse and &filig;nding properly licensed works to reuse should be easy. CC recommends that you mark your licensed works with CC REL. The Creative Commons license chooser provides HTML annotated with CC REL, while the Creative Commons deeds recognize CC REL on web pages with works offered under a CC license, and use this metadata to enhance the deed for properly marked-up works, e.g., by providing copy and paste HTML that includes work attribution.</p>
<p>For more background information on CC REL, please refer to this <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/d/d6/Ccrel-1.0.pdf">paper</a>.</p>


<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-for-a-search-engine-to-be-cc-enabled">What does it mean for a search engine to be CC-enabled?</h4>
<p>Some search engines (like <a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en">Google</a>) allow people to filter their search results by usage rights so that you can limit your search results according to the particular CC license you seek. For example, if you are looking for a photo to adapt, you can filter your search to return photos that have a CC license that permits creation of adaptations. You can generally find this search feature on the advanced search page of your selected search engine. You can also use <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org">CC Search</a>, which offers a convenient interface to search and a list of those content providers that support searches for content based on usage rights.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that you should always double check to make sure that the work you locate through a search is licensed as you wish.</p>
<p><span id="I_want_to_give_users_of_my_site_the_option_to_choose_Creative_Commons_licensing.3B_how_do_I_do_that"></span> <span id="How_can_I_use_Creative_Commons_metadata_in_my_program"></span></p>


<h4 id="how-do-i-give-users-of-my-site-the-option-to-use-cc-licensing-like-flickr-does">How do I give users of my site the option to use CC licensing like Flickr does?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons provides tools for integrating license selection with your site. You can find an overview at the Web Integration article on the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Web_Integration">CC wiki</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Partner_Interface">Partner Interface</a> is a good way to get started and will always have the most up-to-date license versions and translations. However, there is also an <a href="https://api.creativecommons.org/docs/">API</a> available if you want more control.</p>


<h4 id="how-can-i-change-or-remove-the-creative-commons-search-option-built-into-the-firefox-browser">How can I change or remove the Creative Commons search option built into the Firefox browser?</h4>
<p>Mozilla has included the Creative Commons search function in many versions of Firefox along with search options for Google, Amazon, and other popular sites. Please take a look at the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Firefox_and_CC_Search">Firefox article on the CC wiki</a> for an explanation of how to change these features.</p>
<p>If you want to add or remove a particular search option, click on the logo in the search box (for example, the CC logo or the Google logo). This will open the pull down menu, which will allow you to select different search providers. If you choose &ldquo;Manage Search Engines,&rdquo; you will be able to add or remove search engines. You can also alter the order in which the search providers appear on the pull down menu.</p>


<h4 id="is-creative-commons-involved-in-digital-rights-management-drm">Is Creative Commons involved in digital rights management (DRM)?</h4>
<p>No.&nbsp;CC licenses are a form of rights expression, not rights management. CC provides tools to make it easier for creators and owners to say which rights they reserve and permissions they grant. This is different from digital rights management (or &ldquo;DRM&rdquo;), which uses technological protection measures to prevent people from using the work in a way that the owner has not permitted.</p>
<p>CC licenses contain language prohibiting licensees from the use of effective technological measures (including DRM) to prevent access to licensed material: &rdquo;You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any such recipient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While licensors may apply effective technological measures (ETMs) to their own materials, the licensor provides a <a href="#what-if-i-received-cc-licensed-material-encumbered-with-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm">limited permission to circumvent these measures</a>: &ldquo;The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.&rdquo; Note that this only applies to effective technological measures applied by licensors themselves: third parties such as distribution platforms may still apply ETMs if the licensor uploads there, and the license is not able to grant you permission to circumvent it.</p>


<h3 id="legal-background">Legal Background</h3>

<h4 id="what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter">What is copyright and why does it matter?</h4>
<p>Copyright law grants exclusive rights to creators of original works of authorship. National laws usually extend protections to such works automatically once fixed in a tangible medium, prohibiting the making of copies without the rights holder&rsquo;s permission, among other things. On the internet, even the most basic activities involve making copies of copyrighted content. As content is increasingly uploaded, downloaded, and shared online, copyright law is becoming more relevant to more people than it was 20 years ago. Unfortunately, infringing copyrights&mdash;even unintentionally or unknowingly&mdash;can lead to liability. Successful navigation of the internet requires some understanding of copyright law.</p>


<h4 id="what-is-the-public-domain">What is the public domain?</h4>
<p>The public domain of copyright refers to the aggregate of those works that are not restricted by copyright within a given jurisdiction. A work may be part of the public domain because the applicable term of copyright has expired, because the rights holder surrendered copyright in the work with a tool like <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a>, or because the work did not meet the applicable standards for copyrightability.</p>
<p>Because the public domain depends on the copyright laws in force within a particular territory, sometimes a work may be considered &ldquo;in the public domain&rdquo; of one jurisdiction, but not in another. For example, <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105">U.S. government works are automatically in the public domain under U.S. copyright law</a>, but might be restricted by copyright in other countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://publicdomainmanifesto.org/">Public Domain Manifesto</a>, the <a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter8/Stanford">University Libraries</a> page, and the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ">CC0 FAQs</a> all contain additional information about the public domain.</p>

<p><span id="Do_I_need_to_register_my_copyright"></span> <span id="How_do_I_register_my_copyright"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-get-a-copyright">What do I need to do to get a copyright?</h4>
<p>Copyright in most jurisdictions attaches automatically without need for any formality once a creative work is fixed in tangible form (i.e.&nbsp;the minute you put pen to paper, take a photo, or hit the &ldquo;save&rdquo; button on your computer).</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, creators may be required to register with a national agency in order to enforce copyright in court. If you would like more information, please consult the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html">Berne Convention</a> or <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/">your jurisdiction&rsquo;s copyright law</a>.</p>
<p>Although you do not have to apply a copyright notice for your work to be protected, it may be a useful tool to clearly signal to people that the work is yours. It also tells the public who to contact about the work.</p>
<p><span id="What_is_a_derivative_work"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-is-an-adaptation">What is an adaptation?</h4>
<p>An adaptation is a work based on one or more pre-existing works. What constitutes an adaptation depends on applicable law, however translating a work from one language to another or creating a film version of a novel are generally considered adaptations.</p>
<p>In order for an adaptation to be protected by copyright, most national laws require the creator of the adaptation to add original expression to the pre-existing work. However, there is no international standard for originality, and the definition differs depending on the jurisdiction. Civil law jurisdictions (such as <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang=EN&amp;id=1034">Germany</a> and <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/cpialtext.htm">France</a>) tend to require that the work contain an imprint of the adapter&rsquo;s personality. Common law jurisdictions (such as the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103">U.S.</a> or <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-42/index.html">Canada</a>), on the other hand, tend to have a lower threshold for originality, requiring only a minimal level of creativity and &ldquo;independent conception.&rdquo; Some countries approach originality completely differently. For example, <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/text_html.jsp?lang=EN&amp;id=514">Brazil&rsquo;s</a> copyright code protects all works of the mind that do not fall within the list of works that are expressly defined in the statue as &ldquo;unprotected works.&rdquo; Consult <a href="http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/">your jurisdiction&rsquo;s copyright law</a> for more information.</p>
<p><span id="What_are_moral_rights.2C_and_how_could_I_exercise_them_to_prevent_uses_of_my_work_that_I_don.E2.80.99t_like"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-are-moral-rights">What are moral rights?</h4>
<p>Copyright laws in many jurisdictions around the world grant creators &ldquo;moral rights&rdquo; in addition to the economic or commercial right to exploit their creative works. Moral rights protect the personal and reputational value of a work for its creator. Moral rights differ by country, and can include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and/or the right to the integrity of the work. The moral right of integrity may provide creators with a source for redress if an adaptation represents derogatory treatment of their work, typically defined as &ldquo;distortion or mutilation&rdquo; of the work or treatment that is &ldquo;prejudicial to the honor, or reputation of the author.&rdquo; Not all jurisdictions provide for moral rights.</p>
<p>The CC licenses are intended to minimize the effect of moral rights on a licensee&rsquo;s ability to use licensed material; however, in some jurisdictions, these rights may still have an effect. CC offers some additional information on <a href="#how-do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-my-moral-rights-if-at-all" title="wikilink">how CC licenses may affect your moral rights</a>.</p>


<h4 id="what-are-neighboring-rights">What are neighboring rights?</h4>
<p>Copyright provides an incentive to create works by providing exclusive rights to creators. However, the distribution or exploitation of a work often involves more than just the creator. For example, if someone writes a song, someone else may perform the song, and another may produce the recording of the song. Some jurisdictions extend copyright to the contributions made by these persons; other jurisdictions extend such exclusive rights in the form of neighboring rights. Neighboring rights may include performers&rsquo; rights or broadcasters&rsquo; rights, among others. The <a href="http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/rome/summary_rome.html">Rome Convention</a> sets forth some guidelines on the scope of neighboring rights. Not all jurisdictions recognize neighboring rights.</p>


<h4 id="what-are-sui-generis-database-rights">What are sui generis database rights?</h4>
<p>Sui generis database rights grant qualifying database makers the right to prohibit the extraction and reuse of a substantial portion of a database. The rights are granted to database makers that make a substantial investment of time and resources to create the database. Sui generis database rights are primarily enacted within the European Union and a handful of other jurisdictions.</p>


<h4 id="what-are-collecting-societies">What are collecting societies?</h4>
<p><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#International_Harmonization_.E2.80.94_Collecting_Societies">Collecting societies</a> are copyright management organizations. Some examples of collecting societies include ASCAP and BMI (United States), BUMA/STEMRA (Netherlands), PRS (United Kingdom), and APRA (Australia). These societies license works on behalf of their owners and process royalty payments from parties using the copyrighted works.</p>
<p>CC offers additional information on <a href="#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_if_I_am_a_member_of_a_collecting_society" title="wikilink">how collecting societies might affect your rights and your ability to apply CC licenses to your work</a>. CC has several <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Collecting_Society_Projects">pilots</a> underway with collecting societies that have chosen to allow their members to use CC licenses on a limited basis.</p>
<p><span id="When_are_publicity_rights_relevant"></span> <span id="What_are_publicity_and_privacy_rights"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-are-publicity-personality-and-privacy-rights">What are publicity, personality, and privacy rights?</h4>
<p>These terms are used differently in different jurisdictions. Generally speaking, these rights allow individuals to control the use of their voice, image, likeness, or other identifiable aspect of their identity, especially for purposes of commercial exploitation. Similarly, in some jurisdictions these rights allow people to restrict others&rsquo; ability to publish information about them without their permission. Whether and to what extent these rights exist, and if so, how they are labeled, varies depending on the jurisdiction.</p>
<p><a href="#how-are-publicity-privacy-and-personality-rights-affected-when-i-apply-a-cc-license" title="wikilink">Creative Commons licenses have a limited effect on these rights</a> where the licensor holds them. Where the licensor has publicity, personality, or privacy rights that may affect your ability to use the material as the license intends, the licensor agrees to waive or not assert those rights. However, any such rights not held by the licensor are not affected and may still affect your desired use of a licensed work. If you have created a work or wish to use a work that might in some way implicate these rights, you may need to obtain permission from the individuals whose rights may be affected.</p>
