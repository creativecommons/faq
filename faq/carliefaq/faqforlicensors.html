<h2>For Licensors</h2>
<br><br>

<h3>Choosing A License</h3>

<h4 id="what-things-should-i-think-about-before-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license">What things should I think about before I apply a Creative Commons license?</h4>
<p>Applying a Creative Commons license to your material is a serious decision. When you apply a CC license, you give permission to anyone to use your material for the full duration of applicable copyright and similar rights.</p>
<p>CC has identified <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees" title="wikilink">some things that you should consider</a> before you apply a CC license, some of which relate to your ability to apply a CC license at all. Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the material copyrightable? If not, is it subject to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-neighboring-rights">neighboring rights</a> or <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights">sui generis database rights</a>? CC licenses do not apply to material in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-the-public-domain">public domain</a>. Different countries have different standards for what is in the public domain.</li>
<li>Do you own the material you want to license? If not, are you otherwise authorized to license it under the specific CC license you are interested in using? You should not apply a license to material that you do not own or that you are not authorized to license.</li>
<li>Are you aware that CC licenses <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license">are not revocable</a>? You are free to stop offering material under a CC license at any time, but this will not affect the rights associated with any copies of your work already in circulation. (Any particular licensee may lose his or her rights after violating the license, but this does not affect continual use of the work by other licensees.)</li>
<li>Are you a member of a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-collecting-societies">collecting society</a>? If you are, you should <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-use-a-creative-commons-license-if-i-am-a-member-of-a-collecting-society">make sure that you are able to use CC licenses for your materials</a>.</li>
<li>Always read the terms and conditions of the specific license you plan to apply. Additionally, there are several <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License%20Versions">terms that may differ in the earlier versions of the license</a>, both unported and ported. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license">If you choose to use a pre-4.0 version or any ported version</a>, clauses such as choice of law may affect your desired choice of license.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="Which_Creative_Commons_license_should_I_choose"></span></p>


<h4 id="how-should-i-decide-which-license-to-choose">How should I decide which license to choose?</h4>
<p>If you are unsure which license best suits your needs, there are plenty of resources to help rights holders choose the right CC license. CC Australia has developed a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/content/licensing-flowchart.pdf">flow chart</a> that may be useful in helping you settle on the right license for your work. Creative Commons has also compiled <a href="https://creativecommons.org/examples">a list of examples</a> that demonstrate how various licenses fit into licensors&rsquo; overall strategies. You can also <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/">read case studies</a> of others who are using CC licenses. The CC community can also respond to questions, and may have already addressed issues you raise. The CC community <a href="https://creativecommons.org/discuss">email discussion lists</a> and discussion archives may be useful resources.</p>
<p>Finally, you may also want to <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-creative-commons-give-legal-advice-about-its-licenses-or-other-tools-or-help-with-cc-license-enforcement">consult with a lawyer</a> to obtain advice on the best license for your needs.</p>
<p><span id="Why_should_I_use_the_latest_version_.28currently_3.0.29_of_the_Creative_Commons_licenses"></span></p>


<h4 id="why-should-i-use-the-latest-version-of-the-creative-commons-licenses">Why should I use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses?</h4>
<p>The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses is version 4.0. You should always use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses in order to take advantage of the many improvements described on the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License%20Versions">license versions page</a>. In particular, 4.0 is meant to be better suited to international use, and use in many different contexts, including <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data%20FAQ">sharing data</a>.</p>
<p><span id="What_if_CC_licenses_have_not_been_ported_to_my_jurisdiction_.28country.29"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-if-cc-licenses-have-not-been-ported-to-my-jurisdiction">What if CC licenses have not been ported to my jurisdiction?</h4>
<p>All CC licenses are intended to work worldwide. Unless you have a specific reason to use a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license">ported license</a>, we suggest you consider using one of the international licenses. 4.0 will support official translations of the international license for those who wish to use the licenses in another language.</p>
<p>As of version 4.0, CC is discouraging ported versions, and has placed a hold on new porting projects following its publication until sometime in 2014. At that point, CC will reevaluate the necessity of porting in the future.</p>


<h4 id="should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license">Should I choose an international license or a ported license?</h4>
<p>We recommend that you use a version 4.0 international license. This is the most up-to-date version of our licenses, drafted after broad consultation with our global network of affiliates, and it has been written to be internationally valid. There are currently no <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-the-international-unported-creative-commons-licenses-and-why-does-cc-offer-ported-licenses">ports</a> of 4.0, and it is planned that few, if any, will be created.</p>
<p>All of the ported licenses are at version 3.0 or earlier, which means licensors using those licenses do not have the benefit of the <a href="License_versions" title="wikilink">improvements made in the 4.0 license suite</a>. But even before considering the improvements in 4.0, there are several reasons why the <a href="#What_are_the_international_.28.E2.80.9Cunported.E2.80.9D.29_Creative_Commons_licenses.2C_and_why_does_CC_offer_.E2.80.9Cported.E2.80.9D_licenses" title="wikilink">international licenses</a> may be preferable for rights holders, even if the licenses have been ported to their jurisdiction. As an organization, CC itself licenses all of its own content under an international license because, among other reasons, the international licenses are essentially jurisdiction-neutral while remaining effective globally. The neutral nature of the international licenses appeals to many people and organizations, particularly for use in connection with global projects that transcend political borders. Finally, it is important to know that some of the ported licenses contain a choice of law provision, which may be undesirable for your needs.</p>
<p>However, some rights holders still choose a license ported to their local jurisdiction because they believe their needs are not sufficiently met by the international licenses. If the licenses have been ported to your jurisdiction and you feel that the ported licenses better account for some aspect of local legislation, then you may wish to consider a ported license.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction%20Database">use our jurisdiction database</a> to compare international licenses and ports on these issues and others, such as whether a ported license contains a choice of law or forum selection clause.</p>


<h4 id="why-should-i-use-the-license-chooser-what-if-i-dont">Why should I use the license chooser? What if I don&rsquo;t?</h4>
<p>Licensors are not required to use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">CC license chooser</a> or provide any information about themselves or their material when applying a CC license to their material. However, using the license chooser enables licensors to take advantage of the &ldquo;machine readable&rdquo; layer of CC licenses. Our <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL">machine-readable</a> code enhances the discoverability of your work because that code allows software, search engines, and other tools to recognize when something is licensed under a CC license. The code also facilitates attribution: when users click on the CC button placed on your site, they will be linked directly to HTML code that they can cut and paste to provide attribution.</p>
<p><span id="How_do_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons.C2.AE_license_to_my_work"></span> <span id="Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_an_offline_work"></span> <span id="How_do_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_my_work"></span></p>


<h4 id="how-do-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-my-material">How do I apply a Creative Commons license to my material?</h4>
<p><strong>For online material</strong>: Select the license that is appropriate for your material <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">from the CC license chooser</a> and then follow the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#How_to_use_the_CC_License_Chooser">instructions</a> to include the HTML code. The code will automatically generate a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-do-the-creative-commons-buttons-do">license button</a> and a statement that your material is licensed under a CC license. If you are only licensing part of a work (for example, if you have created a video under a CC license but are using a song under a different license), be sure to clearly <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">mark</a> which parts are under the CC license and which parts are not. The HTML code will also include metadata, which allows the material to be discovered via <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons-enabled search engines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For offline material</strong>: Identify which license you wish to apply to your work and either (a) <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Example:_Offline_document">mark your work</a> with a statement such as, &ldquo;This work is licensed under the Creative Commons [insert description] License. To view a copy of the license, visit [insert url]&rdquo;; or (b) insert the applicable <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-do-the-creative-commons-buttons-do">license buttons</a> with the same statement and URL link.</p>
<p><strong>For third-party platforms</strong>: Many <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Content-sharing_platforms">media platforms</a> like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> have built-in Creative Commons capabilities, letting users mark their material with a CC license through their account settings. The benefit of using this functionality is that it allows other people to find your content when <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">searching on those platforms for CC-licensed material</a>. If the platform where you&rsquo;re uploading your content does not support CC licensing, you can still identify your content as CC-licensed in the text description of your content.</p>
<p>Legally, these three options are the same. The only difference between applying a CC license offline rather than online is that marking a work online with metadata will ensure that users will be able to find it through CC-enabled search engines.</p>
<p>CC offers resources on the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">best practices for marking your material</a> and on <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/61/Creativecommons-licensing-and-marking-your-content_eng.pdf">how to mark material in different media (.pdf)</a>.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-need-to-register-with-creative-commons-before-i-obtain-a-license">Do I need to register with Creative Commons before I obtain a license?</h4>
<p>No.&nbsp;CC offers its licenses, code, and tools to the public free of charge, without obligation. You do not need to register with Creative Commons to apply a CC license to your material; it is legally valid as soon as you apply it to any material you have the legal right to license.</p>
<p>CC does not require or provide any means for creators or other rights holders to register use of a CC license, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-creative-commons-collect-or-track-material-licensed-under-a-cc-license">nor does CC maintain a database of works</a> distributed under Creative Commons licenses. CC also does not require registration of the work with a national copyright agency.</p>
<p><span id="Should_I_use_Creative_Commons_licenses_for_software_documentation"></span> <span id="Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-do-the-terms-and-conditions-of-a-cc-license-apply-to">What do the terms and conditions of a CC license apply to?</h4>
<p>Although CC licenses get attached to tangible works (such as photos and novels), the license terms and conditions apply to the licensor&rsquo;s <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#how-do-cc-licenses-operate">copyright</a> in the licensed material. The public is granted &ldquo;permission to exercise&rdquo; those rights in <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it-in-a-different-format">any medium or format</a>. It is the expression that is protected by copyright and covered by the licenses, not any particular medium or format in which the expression is manifested. This means, for example, that a CC license <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-cc-license-to-low-resolution-copies-of-a-licensed-work-and-reserve-more-rights-in-high-resolution-copies">applied to a digitized copy</a> of a novel grants the public permission under copyright to use a print version of the same novel on the same terms and conditions (though you may have to purchase the print version from a bookstore).</p>


<h4 id="can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-software">Can I apply a Creative Commons license to software?</h4>
<p>We recommend against using Creative Commons licenses for software. Instead, we strongly encourage you to use one of the very good software licenses which are already available. We recommend considering <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicenses">licenses listed as free</a> by the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">listed as &ldquo;open source&rdquo;</a> by the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific terms about the distribution of source code, which is often important to ensuring the free reuse and modifiability of software. Many software licenses also address patent rights, which are important to software but may not be applicable to other copyrightable works. Additionally, our licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses, so it would be difficult to integrate CC-licensed work with other free software. Existing software licenses were designed specifically for use with software and offer a similar set of rights to the Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>Version 4.0 of CC&rsquo;s Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license is <a href="https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses">one-way compatible</a> with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License version 3.0</a> (GPLv3). This compatibility mechanism is designed for situations in which content is integrated into software code in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to distinguish the two. There are special considerations required before using this compatibility mechanism. Read more about it <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the CC0 Public Domain Dedication <strong>is</strong> GPL-compatible and acceptable for software. For details, <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F">see the relevant CC0 FAQ entry</a>.</p>
<p>While we recommend against using a CC license on software itself, CC licenses may be used for software documentation, as well as for separate artistic elements such as game art or music.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases">Can I apply a Creative Commons license to databases?</h4>
<p>Yes. CC licenses <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases">can be used on databases</a>. In the 4.0 license suite, applicable <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights">sui generis database rights</a> are licensed under the same license conditions as copyright. Many <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data_and_CC_licenses">governments and others use CC licenses</a> for data and databases.</p>

<h4 id="could-i-use-a-cc-license-to-share-my-logo-or-trademark">Could I use a CC license to share my logo or trademark?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons does not recommend using a CC license on a logo or trademark. While a logo or trademark can be covered by copyright laws in addition to trademark laws, the special purposes of trademarks make CC licenses an unsuitable mechanism for sharing them in most cases. Generally, logos and trademarks are used to identify the origin of a product or service, or to indicate that it meets a specific standard or quality. Allowing anyone to reuse or modify your logo or trademark as a matter of copyright could result in your inability to limit use of your logo or trademark selectively to accomplish those purposes. Applying a CC license to your trademarks and logos could even result in a loss of your trademark rights altogether. See <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-offer-material-under-a-cc-license-that-has-my-trademark-on-it-without-also-licensing-or-affecting-rights-in-the-trademark">below</a> for more about how to license material that includes a trademark or logo.</p>
<p>There are other ways to share your logos and trademarks widely while preserving your trademark rights. Establishing a trademark policy that grants permissions in advance for limited uses is one common alternative. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Trademark_policy">Wikimedia</a>, and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies">Creative Commons</a> have each published policies that accomplish the dual objectives of encouraging reuse and preserving trademark rights.</p>

<h4 id="may-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-a-work-in-the-public-domain">May I apply a Creative Commons license to a work in the public domain?</h4>
<p>CC licenses should not be applied to works in the worldwide <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-the-public-domain">public domain</a>. All CC licenses are clear that they <a href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use">do not have the effect</a> of placing restrictions on material that would otherwise be unrestricted, and you cannot remove a work from the public domain by applying a CC license to it. If you want to dedicate your own work to the public domain before the expiration of applicable copyright or similar rights, use CC&rsquo;s legally robust <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">public domain dedication</a>. If a work is already in the worldwide public domain, you should mark it with CC&rsquo;s <a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm">Public Domain Mark</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, in some cases, a work may be in the public domain under the copyright laws of some jurisdictions but not others. For example, U.S. government works are in the public domain under the copyright law of the United States, but may be protected by copyright laws in other jurisdictions. A CC license applied to such a work would be effective (and the license restrictions enforceable) in jurisdictions where copyright protection exists, but would not be operative if U.S. copyright law is determined to be the applicable law.</p>
<p>Creators may also apply Creative Commons licenses to material they create that are adapted from public domain works, or to remixed material, databases, or collections that include work in the public domain. However, in each of these instances, the license does not affect parts of the work that are unrestricted by copyright or similar rights. We strongly encourage you to <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Creators/Marking_third_party_content">mark the public domain material</a>, so that others know they are also free to use this material without legal restriction.</p>
<p><span id="If_I_take_a_photograph_of_another_work_that_is_out_of_copyright_and_in_the_public_domain,_can_I_apply_a_CC_license_to_my_photo"></span></p>


<h4 id="if-i-take-a-photograph-of-another-work-that-is-in-the-public-domain-can-i-apply-a-cc-license-to-my-photo">If I take a photograph of another work that is in the public domain, can I apply a CC license to my photo?</h4>
<p>That depends. You can apply a CC license to your photograph if your photograph constitutes a work of original authorship, a question that varies by jurisdiction. As a general matter, your photograph must involve some creative choices, such as background setting, lighting, angle, or other mark of creativity. In the United States, an exact photographic copy of a public domain work is not subject to copyright because there is no originality (even if there is effort or &ldquo;sweat&rdquo; exerted in its creation).</p>
<p>In practice, if your photograph is sufficiently creative to attract copyright protection, people will likely have to comply with the license conditions if they reproduce your entire photograph in verbatim form, absent some applicable exception or limitation such as fair use. However, <a href="#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions" title="wikilink">they would not have to comply with the license conditions if they reproduce only those parts of the work in the public domain</a>. This is because your copyright in the adaptation only extends to the material you contributed, not to the underlying work.</p>


<h4 id="may-i-apply-a-cc-license-to-my-work-if-it-incorporates-material-used-under-fair-use-or-another-exception-or-limitation-to-copyright">May I apply a CC license to my work if it incorporates material used under fair use or another exception or limitation to copyright?</h4>
<p>Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material you incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license applies to that material. The CC license only applies to the rights you have in the work. For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a Flickr image you are using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify that image as not being subject to the CC license. For more information about incorporating work owned by others, see our page about <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Creators/Marking_third_party_content" title="wikilink">marking third party content</a>.

<h3>Rights other than copyright</h3>

<h4 id="can-i-use-cc-licenses-to-license-rights-other-than-copyright">Can I use CC licenses to license rights other than copyright?</h4>
<p>CC licenses are copyright licenses, but the latest version of CC licenses also cover certain other rights similar to copyright, including <a href="#what-are-neighboring-rights" title="wikilink">performance, broadcast, and sound recording rights</a>, as well as <a href="#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights" title="wikilink">sui generis database rights</a>. You may apply a 4.0 license to material subject to any of those rights, whether or not the material is also subject to copyright. Note that the scope of prior versions of CC licenses was more limited. You should refer to our <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions" title="wikilink">license versions page</a> for details.</p>


<h4 id="how-do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-my-moral-rights-if-at-all">How do Creative Commons licenses affect my moral rights, if at all?</h4>
<p>As a general matter, all CC licenses preserve <a href="#What_are_moral_rights" title="wikilink">moral rights</a> to the extent they exist (they do not exist everywhere), but allow uses of the work in ways contemplated by the license that might otherwise violate moral rights. If you apply a 4.0 license to your material, you agree to waive or not assert any moral rights you have, to the limited extent necessary to allow the public to exercise the licensed rights. This is designed to minimize the effect of moral rights on licensees&rsquo; ability to use the work, and ensure that the license works internationally as intended. The attribution requirement contained in all of our licenses is intended to satisfy the moral right of attribution, but it must be adhered to whether or not the applicable jurisdiction recognizes moral rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions" title="wikilink">Earlier versions</a> of the license are also intended to minimize the effect of moral rights on otherwise-permitted uses, but the language in the licenses differs. Additionally, jurisdiction ports of earlier versions of CC licenses often contain versions of the moral rights language designed to account for moral rights legislation in a particular jurisdiction. If you are applying a ported license to your work, you may wish to review the moral rights language in the particular license.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction_Database" title="wikilink">compare how different jurisdictions have implemented this provision</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions" title="wikilink">browse the license versions page</a> to compare the treatment of this issue across the different versions of the CC licenses.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-offer-material-under-a-cc-license-that-has-my-trademark-on-it-without-also-licensing-or-affecting-rights-in-the-trademark">Can I offer material under a CC license that has my trademark on it without also licensing or affecting rights in the trademark?</h4>
<p>Yes, you may offer material under a Creative Commons license that includes a trademark indicating the source of the work without affecting rights in the trademark, because trademark rights are not licensed by the CC licenses. However, applying the CC license may create an implied license to use the trademark in connection with the licensed material, although not in ways that require permission under trademark law. To avoid any uncertainty, Creative Commons recommends that licensors who wish to mark material with trademarks or other branding materials give notice to licensors expressly disclaiming application of the license to those elements. This can be done in the copyright notice, but could also be noted on the website where the work is published.</p>

<h4 id="how-are-publicity-privacy-and-personality-rights-affected-when-i-apply-a-cc-license">How are publicity, privacy, and personality rights affected when I apply a CC license?</h4>
<p>When you apply the latest version (4.0) of a CC license to your material, you also agree to waive or not assert any <a href="#what-are-publicity-personality-and-privacy-rights" title="wikilink">publicity, privacy, or personality rights</a> that you hold in the material you are licensing, to the limited extent necessary for others to exercise the licensed rights. For example, if you have licensed a photograph of yourself, you may not assert your right of privacy to have the photo removed from further distribution. (Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, this is implied but not explicit.) If you do not wish to license these rights in this way, you should not apply a CC license to the material where this is a concern.</p>
<p>If there are any third parties who may have publicity, privacy, or personality rights that apply, those rights are not affected by your application of a CC license, and a reuser must seek permission for relevant uses. If you are aware of any such third party rights in the material you are licensing, we recommend <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Noting_third-party_content_in_your_work" title="wikilink">marking the material</a> to give notice to reusers.</p>

<h4 id="can-i-apply-a-cc-license-to-low-resolution-copies-of-a-licensed-work-and-reserve-more-rights-in-high-resolution-copies">Can I apply a CC license to low-resolution copies of a licensed work and reserve more rights in high-resolution copies?</h4>
<p>You may license your copyright or distribute your work under more than one set of terms. For example, you may publish a photograph on your website, but only distribute high-resolution copies to people who have paid for access. This is a practice CC supports. However, if the low-resolution and high-resolution copies are the <a href="#how-do-i-know-if-a-low-resolution-photo-and-a-high-resolution-photo-are-the-same-work" title="wikilink">same work under applicable copyright law</a>, permission under a CC license is not limited to a particular copy, and someone who receives a copy in high resolution may use it under the terms of the CC license applied to the low-resolution copy.</p>
<p>Note that, although CC <a href="#can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work" title="wikilink">strongly discourages the practice</a>, CC cannot prevent licensors from attempting to impose restrictions through separate agreements on uses the license otherwise would allow. In that case, licensees may be <a href="#what-if-i-have-received-cc-licensed-material-with-additional-restrictions" title="wikilink">contractually restricted</a> from using the high-resolution copy, for example, even if the licensor has placed a CC license on the low-resolution copy.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-use-a-creative-commons-license-if-i-am-a-member-of-a-collecting-society">Can I use a Creative Commons license if I am a member of a collecting society?</h4>
<p>Creators and other rights holders may wish to check with their <a href="#what-are-collecting-societies" title="wikilink">collecting society</a> before applying a CC license to their material. Many rights holders who are members of a collecting society can waive the right to collect royalties for uses allowed under the license, but only to the extent their societies allow.</p>
<p>Collecting societies in several countries including Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Taiwan, and the Netherlands take an assignment of rights from creators in present and future works and manage them, so that the societies effectively become the owner of these rights. (In France it is called a &ldquo;mandate&rdquo; of rights but has similar practical effect.) Creators in these jurisdictions who belong to collecting societies may not be able to license their material under CC licenses because the collecting societies own the necessary rights, not the creators. CC is <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Collecting_Society_Projects" title="wikilink">working with several collecting societies</a> and running pilot programs that allow creators to use CC licenses in some circumstances.</p>
<p>If you are already a member of a collecting society and want to use CC licenses, you are welcome to encourage your collecting society to give you the option of Creative Commons licensing.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-still-make-money-from-a-work-i-make-available-under-a-creative-commons-license">Can I still make money from a work I make available under a Creative Commons license?</h4>
<p>Yes. One of our goals is to encourage creators and rights holders to experiment with new ways to promote and market their work. There are several possible ways of doing this.</p>
<p>CC&rsquo;s <a href="#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses" title="wikilink">NonCommercial (NC)</a> licenses allow rights holders to maximize distribution while maintaining control of the commercialization of their works. If you want to reserve the right to commercialize your work, you may do this by choosing a license with the NC condition. If someone else wants to use your work commercially and you have applied an NC license to your work, they must first get your permission. As the rights holder, you may still sell your own work commercially.</p>
<p>You may also use funding models that do not depend on using an NC license. For example, many artists and creators use crowdfunding to fund their work before releasing it under a less restrictive license. Others use a &ldquo;freemium&rdquo; model where the basic content is free, but extras such as a physical printed version or special access to a members-only website are for paying customers only.</p>

<p><span id="Can_I_insist_on_the_exact_placement_of_the_attribution_credit_for_my_work"></span></p>


<h4 id="can-i-insist-on-the-exact-placement-of-the-attribution-credit">Can I insist on the exact placement of the attribution credit?</h4>
<p>No.&nbsp;CC licenses allow for flexibility in the way credit is provided depending on the medium, means, and context in which a licensee is redistributing licensed material. For example, providing attribution to the creator when using licensed material in a blog post may be different than doing so in a video remix. This flexibility facilitates compliance by licensees and reduces uncertainty about different types of reuse&mdash;minimizing the risk that overly onerous and inflexible attribution requirements are simply disregarded.</p>
<p><span id="Can_I_change_the_terms_of_a_CC_license_or_waive_some_of_its_conditions"></span></p>


<h4 id="can-i-change-the-license-terms-or-conditions">Can I change the license terms or conditions?</h4>
<p>Yes&mdash;but if you change the terms and conditions of any Creative Commons license, you <em>must no longer call, label, or describe the license as a &ldquo;Creative Commons&rdquo; or &ldquo;CC&rdquo; license</em>, nor can you use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies">Creative Commons logos, buttons, or other trademarks</a> in connection with the modified license or your materials. Keep in mind that altering terms and conditions is distinct from <a href="#Can_I_waive_license_terms_or_conditions" title="wikilink">waiving existing conditions or granting additional permissions</a> than those in the licenses. Licensors may always do so, and many choose to do so using the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus" title="wikilink">CC+ protocol</a> to readily signal the waiver or additional permission on the CC license deed.</p>
<p>CC does not assert copyright in the text of its licenses, so you are permitted to modify the text as long as you do not use the CC marks to describe it. However, we do not recommend this. We also advise against <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Modifying_the_CC_licenses" title="wikilink">modifying our licenses</a> through indirect means, such as in your terms of service. A modified license very likely will not be compatible with the same CC license (unmodified) applied to other material. This would prevent licensees from using, combining, or remixing content under your customized license with other content under the same or compatible CC licenses.</p>
<p>Modifying licenses creates friction that confuses users and undermines the key benefits of public, standardized licenses. Central to our licenses is the grant of a standard set of permissions in advance, without requiring users to ask for permission or seek clarification before using the work. This encourages sharing and facilitates reuse, since everyone knows what to expect and the burden of negotiating permissions on a case by case basis is eliminated.</p>


<h4 id="can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions">Can I waive license terms or conditions?</h4>
<p>Yes. You may always choose to waive some license terms or conditions. Material licensed under a CC license but with additional permissions granted or conditions waived may be compatibly licensed with other material under the same license. Our <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus" title="wikilink">CC+ protocol</a> provides a mechanism for facilitating that grant or waiver.</p>
<p><span id="Can_I_enter_into_separate_agreements_or_understandings_with_users_outside_the_scope_of_the_license"></span></p>


<h4 id="can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work">Can I enter into separate or supplemental agreements with users of my work?</h4>
<p>Yes. CC licenses are nonexclusive. Licensors always have the option of entering into separate arrangements for the sharing of their material in addition to applying a CC license. However, those different arrangements are not &ldquo;CC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Creative Commons&rdquo; licenses.</p>
<p><strong>Separate agreements:</strong> You may offer the licensed material under other licenses in addition to the CC license (a practice commonly referred to as &ldquo;dual licensing&rdquo;). For example, you may wish to license a video game soundtrack under both a CC license and the GPL, so that it may be used under either set of terms. A reuser may then choose which set of terms to comply with. Or, for example, you may offer your material to the public under a NonCommercial license, but offer commercial permissions to fee-paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>Supplemental agreements:</strong> Problems arise when licensors design those terms or arrangements to serve not as separate, alternative licensing arrangements but as supplemental terms <a href="#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions" title="wikilink">having the effect of changing the standard terms within the CC license</a>. While you may offer separate terms and conditions to other parties, you should not do so in such a way that would neutralize terms of the CC license.</p>
<p>Except in the limited situation where <a href="#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions" title="wikilink">more permissions are being granted or license conditions are waived</a>, if the additional arrangement modifies or conflicts with the CC license terms, then the resulting licensing arrangement is no longer a CC licensing arrangement. To avoid confusing those who may mistakenly believe the work is licensed under standard CC terms, we must insist that in these instances licensors not use our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/policies">trademarks, names, and logos</a> in connection with their custom licensing arrangement.</p>
<p>It should be noted that any agreements you make with other parties only have an effect on the other parties to that agreement, and do not apply to anyone else receiving the licensed material. For example, if there are terms of use that apply to visitors to your website on which you host CC-licensed material, your terms of use may apply to visitors to that website, but not to anyone who receives copies of the CC-licensed material elsewhere. Even for the visitors to your website, any separate terms and conditions do not become part of the license&mdash;they remain a separate contractual agreement, and violation of this agreement does not constitute copyright infringement.</p>


<h3 id="after-licensing">After licensing</h3>


<h4 id="what-happens-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-someone-misuses-them">What happens if I offer my material under a Creative Commons license and someone misuses them?</h4>
<p>A CC license <a href="#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back" title="wikilink">terminates automatically</a> when its conditions are violated. For example, if a reuser of CC-licensed material does not provide the attribution required when sharing the work, then the user no longer has the right to continue using the material and may be liable for copyright infringement. The license is terminated for the user who violated the license. However, all other users still have a valid license, so long as they are in compliance.</p>
<p>Under the 4.0 licenses, a licensee automatically gets these rights back if she fixes the violation within 30 days of discovering it.</p>
<p>If you apply a Creative Commons license and a user violates the license conditions, you may opt to contact the person directly to ask them to rectify the situation or consult a lawyer to act on your behalf. Creative Commons is not a law firm and cannot represent you or give you legal advice, but there are <a href="#Can_Creative_Commons_give_legal_advice_about_its_licenses_or_other_tools.2C_or_help_with_CC_license_enforcement.3F" title="wikilink">lawyers who have identified themselves as interested in representing people in CC-related matters</a>.</p>

<p>As long as users abide by license terms and conditions, licensors cannot control how the material is used. However, CC licenses do provide several mechanisms that allow licensors to choose not to be associated with their material or to uses of their material with which they disagree.</p>
<p>First, all CC licenses <a href="#do-i-need-to-be-aware-of-anything-else-when-providing-attribution" title="wikilink">prohibit using the attribution requirement to suggest that the licensor endorses or supports a particular use</a>. Second, licensors may waive the attribution requirement, choosing not to be identified as the licensor, if they wish. Third, if the licensor does not like how the material has been modified or used, CC licenses require that the licensee <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Licensors_may_request_removal_of_attribution">remove the attribution information upon request</a>. (In 3.0 and earlier, this is only a requirement for adaptations and collections; in 4.0, this also applies to the unmodified work.) Finally, anyone modifying licensed material must <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Modifications_and_adaptations_must_be_indicated" title="wikilink">indicate that the original has been modified</a>. This ensures that changes made to the original material&ndash;whether or not the licensor approves of them&ndash;are not attributed back to the licensor.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-i-do-if-someone-tries-to-place-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-on-my-cc-licensed-material">What do I do if someone tries to place effective technological measures (such as DRM) on my CC-licensed material?</h4>
<p>The use of <a href="#can-i-use-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-when-i-share-cc-licensed-material">any effective technical protection measures (such as digital rights management or &ldquo;DRM&rdquo;)</a> by licensees to prevent others from exercising the licensed rights is prohibited.</p>
<p>Not all kinds of encryption or <a href="#can-i-share-cc-licensed-material-on-password-protected-sites" title="wikilink">access limitations</a> are prohibited by the licenses. For example, sending content via email and encrypting it with the recipient&rsquo;s public key does not restrict use of the work by the recipient. Likewise, limiting recipients to a particular set of users (for example, by requiring a username and password to enter a site) does not restrict further use of the content by the recipients. In these examples, these things do not prevent the recipient from exercising all of the rights granted by the license, including the right to redistribute it further.</p>
<p>If someone is applying effective technological measures to your CC-licensed material that do restrict exercise of the licensed rights (such as applying DRM that restricts copying), this is a violation of the license terms unless you have chosen to grant this permission separately.</p>


<h4 id="when-i-release-my-work-under-a-cc-license-in-one-format-e.g.-.pdf-can-i-restrict-licensees-from-changing-it-to-or-using-it-in-other-formats">When I release my work under a CC license in one format (e.g., .pdf), can I restrict licensees from changing it to or using it in other formats?</h4>
<p>No.&nbsp;CC licenses grant permission to use the licensed material in any media or format regardless of the format in which it has been made available. This is true even if you have applied a NoDerivatives license to your work. Once a CC license is applied to a work in one format or medium, a licensee may use the same work in any other format or medium without violating the licensor&rsquo;s copyright.</p>
<p><span id="What_if_I_change_my_mind"></span></p>


<h4 id="what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license">What if I change my mind about using a CC license?</h4>
<p>CC licenses are not revocable. Once something has been published under a CC license, licensees may continue using it according to the license terms for the duration of applicable copyright and similar rights. As a licensor, you may stop distributing under the CC license at any time, but anyone who has access to a copy of the material may continue to redistribute it under the CC license terms. While you cannot revoke the license, CC licenses do provide a <a href="#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it" title="wikilink">mechanism</a> for licensors to ask that others using their material remove the attribution information. You should <a href="Considerations%20for%20licensors%20and%20licensees" title="wikilink">think carefully before choosing a Creative Commons license</a>.</p>
