I am Carlie Thomas, aspiring fulls stack developer with particular interests in Python and Django and with design skills using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap4 and JavaScript. I am currently on the Outreachy Internship application stage.

I am 31 years of age from the UK, near London, and completely self taught, having dedicated the last year to learning how to code and program in between parenting my two children. I am fully dedicated and in love with tech and coding and offer my services for free where I can in order to gain experience. 

In this project I hope I have managed to create an FAQ page that truly incorporates Creative Common's ethics and style. I love the idea of Creative Common and haven't come across another business quite like this one. I was fascinated as I read through each and every question, really trying to grasp what the company is about and how it serves its clients so well. 

The FAQ I have created is scaled down to a less intimidating layout, with the option to expand boxes which group together specific questions under 6 different headings. Upon clicking on a question you will be diverted to a specifically created page for that particular topic where you will find the answer to your question. 

I understand the project wanted to scale down to 10 questions, however there are so many complex areas I felt it would be more ideal to find a way of incorporating all of those important questions, but in a layout that wasn't quite so long and 'list-like'. 

I would also like to incorporate a way of directing the reader to their exact answer once the question has been clicked, but I first wished to gain some feedback before I continued adjusting and changing - this might be a mile away from anything you wished for!

I look forward to hearing any feedback you may have for me

Carlie
