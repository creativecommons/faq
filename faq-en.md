#### What is Creative Commons and what do you do?

Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing
and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free
legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of
their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms;
those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to
benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realize the
full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates [all over the
world](https://creativecommons.org/international/) who help ensure our
licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work.

Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work
extends beyond just providing copyright licenses. CC offers other legal
and technical tools that also facilitate sharing and discovery of
creative works, such as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/),
a public domain dedication for rights holders who wish to put their work
into the public domain before the expiration of copyright, and the
[Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0),
a tool for marking a work that is in the worldwide public domain.
Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed specifically to work
with the web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy
to search for, discover, and use.

For more information about CC, our [main
website](https://creativecommons.org) contains in-depth information about
[the organization](https://creativecommons.org/about/), its [staff and
board of directors](https://creativecommons.org/staff/), its
[history](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/History), and its
[supporters](https://creativecommons.org/supporters/). You can
also read [CC case
studies](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies) to learn about
some of the inspiring ways CC licenses and tools have been used to share
works and support innovative business models. You can find regularly
updated information about CC by visiting the
[blog](https://creativecommons.org/weblog).

#### Is Creative Commons against copyright?

Absolutely not. CC has [responded to claims to the
contrary](https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22643). CC licenses
are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to
work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators and other rights holders
can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving
other rights. Those who want to make their work available to the public
for limited kinds of uses while preserving their copyright may want to
consider using CC licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their
rights under copyright law should not use CC licenses.

That said, Creative Commons recognizes the need for change in copyright
law, and many members of the Creative Commons community are active
participants in the copyright reform movement. For more information, see
our [statement in support of copyright
reform](https://creativecommons.org/about/reform).

#### What does "Some Rights Reserved" mean?

[Copyright](#what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter)
grants to creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their creative
works, which generally include, at a minimum, the right to reproduce,
distribute, display, and make adaptations. The phrase "All Rights
Reserved" is often used by owners to indicate that they reserve all of
the rights granted to them under the law. When copyright expires, the
work enters the [ public
domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), and the rights holder
can no longer stop others from engaging in those activities under
copyright, with the exception of moral rights reserved to creators in
some jurisdictions. Creative Commons licenses offer creators a spectrum
of choices between retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights
(public domain), an approach we call "Some Rights Reserved."

<span id="Will_Creative_Commons_help_me_enforce_my_license"></span>
<span id="Can_Creative_Commons_give_legal_advice_about_its_licenses_or_help_with_CC_license_enforcement"></span>

#### Can Creative Commons give legal advice about its licenses or other tools, or help with CC license enforcement?

No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice
or legal services. CC is similar to a self-help service that offers
free, form-based legal documents for others to use. These FAQ answers
many of the most common questions. There is also specialized information
available on the following pages:

-   [Marking practices for creators](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license "wikilink")
-   [Marking practices for reusers](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution "wikilink")
-   [Data FAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain "wikilink")

-   [CC0 FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ "wikilink")

While CC does provide this informational guidance about its licenses and
other tools, this information may not apply to your particular
situation, and should never be taken as legal advice.

If you're looking for legal advice about using CC licenses and other
tools, we recommend contacting the [Creative Commons affiliate in your
jurisdiction](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Affiliate_Network "wikilink"). CC affiliates are highly
connected to the communities of copyright lawyers in their countries. We
also offer a [list of lawyers and
organizations](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_Friendly_Lawyers "wikilink") who have identified
themselves as willing to provide information to others about CC
licensing issues. However, please note that CC does not provide referral
services, and does not endorse or recommend any person on that list.

<span id="Does_Creative_Commons_collect_or_track_materials_licensed_under_a_CC_license"></span>

#### Does Creative Commons collect or track material licensed under a CC license?

No, CC does not collect content or track licensed material. However, CC
builds technical tools that help the public search for and use works
licensed under our licenses and other legal tools, and many others have
built such tools as well. [CC
Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/) is one tool developed by CC
to help the public discover works offered under Creative Commons
licenses on the internet via CC-aware search engines and repositories.

#### What do the Creative Commons buttons do?

The CC buttons are a shorthand way to convey the basic permissions
associated with material offered under CC licenses. Creators and owners
who apply CC licenses to their material can [download and apply those
buttons](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads) to communicate to
users the permissions granted in advance. When the material is offered
online, the buttons should usually link out to the human-readable
license deeds (which, in turn, link to the license itself).

<span id="Can_I_change_the_Creative_Commons_logos_so_that_they_look_better_on_my_site_or_with_my_work"></span>

#### May I use the Creative Commons logo and buttons?

You may [download high resolution
versions](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads) of the Creative
Commons logos and use them in connection with your work or your website,
provided you comply with our
[policies](https://creativecommons.org/policies). Among other things, if
you use the logos on a website or on your work, you may not alter the
logos in any respect—such as by changing the font, the proportions, or
the colors. CC's buttons, name, and corporate logo (the “CC” in a
circle) are trademarks of Creative Commons. You cannot use them in ways
not permitted by our policies unless you first receive express, written
permission. This means, for example, that you cannot (without our
permission) print your own buttons and t-shirts using CC logos, although
you can purchase them in CC’s
[store](https://creativecommons.org/store/).

<span id="I_love_what_Creative_Commons_does._How_can_I_help"></span>

#### I love Creative Commons. How can I help?

Please support CC by making a donation through our [support
page](https://creativecommons.org/donate/). Donations can be handled through PayPal or by credit
card. You can also support CC by visiting our
[store](http://creativecommons.org/store).

CC always welcomes your feedback, which you can provide by emailing
<info@creativecommons.org>. You can also participate in CC's [email
discussion lists](https://creativecommons.org/contact#discuss) and share
feedback and ideas in one of those forums.

If you are a software developer, sysadmin, or have other technical
expertise, please [join our developer
community](https://creativecommons.github.io/community/) and help
build the tools that build the commons.

Finally, one of the best ways to support CC is by supporting our causes
yourself. Follow our [blog](https://creativecommons.org/weblog/) to find
out about current issues where you can help get involved and spread the
word, and advocate for free and open licensing in your own communities.

<span id="Who_funds_Creative_Commons"></span>

#### Why does Creative Commons run an annual fundraising campaign? What is the money used for and where does it go?

Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing
and reuse of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools, with
affiliates all over the world who help ensure our licenses work
internationally and raise awareness about our work. Our tools are free,
and our reach is wide.

In order to...

-   continue developing our licenses and public domain tools to make
    sure they are legally and technically up-to-date around the world,
-   help creators implement these tools on websites through best
    practices and individual assistance,
-   enable CC licensing on major content-sharing platforms,
-   enhance CC-licensed resource search and discovery,
-   advocate for CC licensing and open policies in
    [education](https://creativecommons.org/education),
    [science](https://creativecommons.org/science), and
    [culture](https://creativecommons.org/culture), and
-   myriad other activities we're forgetting to mention, such as all the
    everyday boring but essential operations that go into running an
    organization

...we need \$ to make it all happen! For more information, please take a
look at our [Annual Report](https://stateof.creativecommons.org/).

Creative Commons has always relied on the generosity of both individuals
and organizations to fund its ongoing operations. It is essential we
have the public's support because it is the creators and users of CC
material who make our tools relevant in this digital age. They depend on
the tools and services CC provides through their reuse and remix of the
rich, open resources available on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org),
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com), [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/),
[Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/), [Europeana](http://www.europeana.eu/),
[MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/), the [Library of
Science](http://www.plos.org/Public), [Al
Jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com/), and
[YouTube](http://youtube.com)—just to name a few. Many of these people
donate \$10, \$25, or \$50 to CC, to help keep it up and running so we
can continue to provide our tools and services for free, as a nonprofit
organization. The more people who [donate](https://donate.creativecommons.org/)
to CC, the more independent it will remain.

### General License Information

<span id="How_does_a_Creative_Commons_license_operate"></span>
<span id="What_are_the_terms_of_a_Creative_Commons_license"></span>

#### What are Creative Commons licenses?

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) provide
an easy way to manage the copyright terms that attach automatically to
all creative material under
[copyright](#what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter ).
Our licenses allow that material to be shared and reused under terms
that are flexible and legally sound. Creative Commons offers a core
suite of six copyright licenses. Because there is no single "Creative
Commons license," it is important to identify [which of the six
licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) you are applying to your
material, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that
you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version.

All of our licenses require that users provide attribution (BY) to the
creator when the material is used and shared. Some licensors choose the
BY license, which requires attribution to the creator as the only
condition to reuse of the material. The other five licenses combine BY
with one or more of three additional license elements: NonCommercial
(NC), which prohibits commercial use of the material; NoDerivatives
(ND), which prohibits the sharing of adaptations of the material; and
ShareAlike (SA), which requires adaptations of the material be released
under the same license.

CC licenses may be applied to any type of work, including [educational
resources](https://creativecommons.org/education/ "wikilink"), [music](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Musician "wikilink"),
[photographs](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Photography "wikilink"), [databases](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data "wikilink"),
[government and public sector
information](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Government_use_of_Creative_Commons "wikilink"), and [many
other types of material](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Case_Studies "wikilink"). The only categories
of works for which CC does not recommend its licenses are [ computer
software](#Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_software )
and hardware. You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses to
works that are [no longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the
public
domain](#May_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_a_work_in_the_public_domain ).
Instead, for those works in the worldwide public domain, we recommend
that you mark them with the [Public Domain
Mark](https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm).

#### How do CC licenses operate?

CC licenses are operative only when applied to material in which a
[copyright]( http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter)
exists, and even then only when a particular use would otherwise not be
permitted by copyright. Note that the latest version of CC licenses also
applies to rights similar to copyright, such as [neighboring
rights](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-neighboring-rights) and [sui generis
database rights](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights).
[Learn more about the scope of the
licenses.](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-use-cc-licenses-to-license-rights-other-than-copyright)
This means that CC license terms and conditions are **not** triggered by
[uses permitted under any applicable exceptions and limitations to
copyright](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use),
nor do license terms and conditions apply to elements of a licensed work
that are in the public domain. This also means that CC licenses do not
contractually impose restrictions on uses of a work where there is no
underlying copyright. This feature (and others) [distinguish CC licenses
from some other open
licenses](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-the-open-data-commons-licenses-and-the-cc-4.0-licenses)
like the [ODbL](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) and
[ODC-BY](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/), both of which are
intended to [impose contractual conditions and
restrictions](http://opendatacommons.org/faq/licenses/#db-versus-contents)
on the reuse of databases in jurisdictions where there is no underlying
copyright or sui generis database right.

All CC licenses are non-exclusive: [creators and owners can enter into
additional, different licensing
arrangements](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work)
for the same material at any time (often referred to as “dual-licensing”
or “multi-licensing”). However, [CC licenses are not
revocable](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license)
once granted unless there has been a breach, and even then the license
is terminated only for the breaching licensee.

There are also [videos and comics](https://creativecommons.org/videos/)
that offer visual descriptions of how CC licenses work.

#### Which is the latest version of the licenses offered by Creative Commons?

In November 2013, Creative Commons published the version 4.0 license
suite. These licenses are the most up-to-date licenses offered by CC,
and are recommended over all prior versions. You can see how the
licenses have been improved over time on the [license versions
page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions). 4.0 has been drafted to be
internationally valid, and will have official translations becoming
available after publication.

<span id="Do_Creative_Commons_licenses_affect_fair_use.2C_fair_dealing_or_other_exceptions_to_copyright"></span>

#### Do Creative Commons licenses affect exceptions and limitations to copyright, such as fair dealing and fair use?

No. By design, CC licenses do not reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
under exceptions and limitations to copyright, such as [fair
use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) or [fair
dealing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing). If your use of
CC-licensed material would otherwise be allowed because of an applicable
exception or limitation, you do not need to rely on the CC license or
comply with its terms and conditions. [This is a fundamental principle
of CC
licensing.](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#how-do-cc-licenses-operate)

#### Who gives permission to use material offered under Creative Commons licenses?

Our licenses and legal tools are intended for use by anyone who holds
copyright in the material. This is often, but not always, the creator.

Creative Commons offers licenses and tools to the public free of charge
and does not require that creators or other rights holders register with
CC in order to apply a CC license to a work. This means that [CC does
not have special knowledge of who uses the
licenses](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-creative-commons-collect-or-track-material-licensed-under-a-cc-license)
and for what purposes, nor does CC have a way to contact creators beyond
means generally available to the public. CC has no authority to grant
permission on behalf of those persons, nor does CC manage those rights
on behalf of others.

If you would like to obtain additional permissions to use the work
beyond those granted by the license that has been applied, or if you’re
not sure if your intended use is permitted by the license, you should [
contact the rights
holder](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-happens-if-i-want-to-use-the-material-in-a-way-that-is-not-permitted-by-the-license).

<span id="Does_Creative_Commons_host_or_own_any_content"></span>
<span id="Is_Creative_Commons_building_a_database_of_licensed_content"></span>
<span id="Does_Creative_Commons_determine_what_content_is_released_under_its_licenses"></span>

#### Are Creative Commons licenses enforceable in a court of law?

Creative Commons licenses are drafted to be enforceable around the
world, and have been [enforced in
court](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Law) in various
jurisdictions. To CC's knowledge, the licenses have never been held
unenforceable or invalid.

CC licenses contain a “severability” clause. This allows a court to
eliminate any provision determined to be unenforceable, and enforce the
remaining provisions of the license.

#### What happens if someone applies a Creative Commons license to my work without my knowledge or authorization?

CC [alerts prospective
licensors](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing) they need
to have all necessary rights before applying a CC license to a work. If
that is not the case and someone has marked your work with a CC license
without your authorization, you should contact that person and tell them
to remove the license from your work. You may also wish to contact a
lawyer. Creative Commons is not a law firm and cannot represent you or
give you legal advice, but there are [ lawyers who have identified
themselves as interested in representing people in CC-related
matters](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-creative-commons-give-legal-advice-about-its-licenses-or-other-tools-or-help-with-cc-license-enforcement).

<span id="What_are_the_international_.28.22unported.22.29_CC_licenses.2C_and_why_does_CC_offer_.E2.80.9Cported.E2.80.9D_licenses"></span>

#### What are the international (“unported”) Creative Commons licenses, and why does CC offer “ported” licenses?

One of CC’s goals is ensuring that all of its legal tools work globally,
so that anyone anywhere in the world can share their work on globally
standard terms. To this end, CC offers a core suite of six international
copyright licenses (formerly called the "unported") that are drafted
based largely on various [international treaties governing
copyright](http://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/treaties.htm), taking into
account as many jurisdiction-specific legal issues as possible. The
latest version (4.0) has been drafted with particular attention to the
needs of international enforceability.

For version 3.0 and earlier, Creative Commons has also offered ported
versions of its six core licenses for many jurisdictions (which usually
correspond to countries, but not always). These ported licenses are
based on the international license suite but have been modified to
reflect local nuances in the expression of legal terms and conditions,
drafting protocols, and language. The ported licenses and the
international licenses are all intended to be legally effective
everywhere. CC expects that few, if any, ports will be necessary for
4.0.

CC recommends that you take advantage of the improvements in the 4.0
suite explained on the [license versions
page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions) unless there are [particular
considerations you are aware
of](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license)
that would require a ported license.

#### Can I include a work licensed with CC BY in a Wikipedia article even though they use a CC BY-SA license?

Yes. Works licensed under CC BY may be incorporated into works that are
licensed under CC BY-SA. For example, you may incorporate a CC BY
photograph into a Wikipedia article so long as you keep all copyright
notices intact, provide proper attribution, and otherwise comply with
the terms of CC BY. [Learn more](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
about the licenses.

<span id="#Why_should_governments_and_intergovernmental_organizations_.28.22IGOs.22.29_use_CC_licenses"></span>

#### Can governments and intergovernmental organizations ("IGOs") use CC licenses?

Yes, anyone may use CC licenses for material they own, including
governments and IGOs, and these institutions [frequently use CC licenses
on their copyrightable material](Government "wikilink"). The reasons for
doing so vary, and often include a desire to maximize the impact and
utility of works for educational and informational purposes, and to
enhance transparency.

Creative Commons licenses have [desirable
features](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) that make them the
preferred choice over custom licenses. CC licenses are standard and
interoperable, which means material published by different creators
using the same type of CC license can be translated, modified, compiled,
and remixed without legal barriers depending on the [particular license
applied](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work).
Creative Commons licenses are also machine-readable, allowing
CC-licensed works to be easily discovered via search engines such as
Google. These features maximize distribution, reuse, and impact of works
published by governments and IGOs.

Though we encourage anyone to use version 4.0, which is internationally
valid and may be used by individuals as well as organizations, there is
an IGO ported version of 3.0 that IGOs may also use. Read more about how
[governments](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Government_use_of_Creative_Commons) and [IGOs](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Organizations) use and
leverage CC licenses and legal tools, considerations for using our
licenses, and [how they operate in the IGO
context.](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Organizations)

<span id="What_are_the_official_translations_of_the_CC_licenses"></span>
<span id="officialtranslations"></span>

#### Can children apply Creative Commons licenses to work they create?

This issue depends largely on the laws in place where the child lives. In the United States, children can be copyright holders and are entitled to license their works in the same manner as adults. However, they may have the right to disaffirm certain types of legal agreements, including licenses. In many parts of the United States, for example, children have the ability to disaffirm some types of agreements under certain circumstances once they reach the age where they are considered adults within the relevant jurisdiction. We are unaware of any attempt by a licensor to exercise the disaffirmation right with respect to a CC license applied to a work.


#### What are the official translations of the CC licenses and CC0?

Official language translations will be available for the 4.0 licenses
and CC0. When you license your own work, you may use or link to the text
of any available official translation. When you reuse CC-licensed
material, you may comply with the license conditions by referring to any
available official translation of the license. These translations are
linguistic translations of the English version which adhere as closely
as possible to the original text. These translations have been done by
our affiliates in accordance with the [Legal Code Translation
Policy](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal%20Code%20Translation%20Policy) and with the oversight
and detailed review of the CC legal team. Note that these are
equivalents of the original English; these translations are *not*
[jurisdiction ported
versions](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-the-international-unported-creative-commons-licenses-and-why-does-cc-offer-ported-licenses).
You may find a list of all available translations
[here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Legal_Tools_Translation#Published_translations).

For versions 3.0 and earlier, official translations are not available.
Some unofficial translations were made for informational purposes only.
(Jurisdiction ported versions of version 3.0 and earlier were generally
published in the official language(s) of the appropriate jurisdiction.
However, the ported licenses are [not
equivalent](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-should-i-know-about-differences-between-the-international-licenses-and-the-ported-licenses)
to the international licenses, and do not serve as substitutable
references for purposes of complying with the terms and conditions of
the licenses.)

#### What is a BY-SA Compatible License?

A BY-SA Compatible License is a license officially designated by
Creative Commons pursuant to the [ShareAlike compatibility
process](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/ShareAlike_compatibility_criteria).
Once deemed a BY-SA Compatible License, you may use the license to
publish your contributions to an adaptation of a BY-SA work. To see the

## For Licensors

### Choosing a license

<span id="What_things_should_I_think_about_before_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_my_work"></span>

#### What things should I think about before I apply a Creative Commons license?

Applying a Creative Commons license to your material is a serious
decision. When you apply a CC license, you give permission to anyone to
use your material for the full duration of applicable copyright and
similar rights.

CC has identified [some things that you should
 consider](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees "wikilink") before
you apply a CC license, some of which relate to your ability to apply a
CC license at all. Here are some highlights:

-   Is the material copyrightable? If not, is it subject to [neighboring
    rights](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-neighboring-rights) or [sui generis
    database
    rights](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights)? CC
    licenses do not apply to material in the [public
    domain](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-the-public-domain). Different
    countries have different standards for what is in the public domain.
-   Do you own the material you want to license? If not, are you
    otherwise authorized to license it under the specific CC license you
    are interested in using? You should not apply a license to material
    that you do not own or that you are not authorized to license.
-   Are you aware that CC licenses [are not
    revocable](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-if-i-change-my-mind-about-using-a-cc-license)?
    You are free to stop offering material under a CC license at any
    time, but this will not affect the rights associated with any copies
    of your work already in circulation. (Any particular licensee may
    lose his or her rights after violating the license, but this does
    not affect continual use of the work by other licensees.)
-   Are you a member of a [collecting
    society](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-collecting-societies)? If you are,
    you should [make sure that you are able to use CC licenses for your
    materials](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-use-a-creative-commons-license-if-i-am-a-member-of-a-collecting-society).
-   Always read the terms and conditions of the specific license you
    plan to apply. Additionally, there are several [terms that may
    differ in the earlier versions of the
    license](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License%20Versions), both unported and ported. [If
    you choose to use a pre-4.0 version or any ported
    version](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license),
    clauses such as choice of law may affect your desired choice of
    license.

#### How should I decide which license to choose?

If you are unsure which license best suits your needs, there are plenty
of resources to help rights holders choose the right CC license. CC
Australia has developed a [flow
chart](http://creativecommons.org.au/content/licensing-flowchart.pdf)
that may be useful in helping you settle on the right license for your
work. Creative Commons has also compiled [a list of
examples](https://creativecommons.org/examples) that demonstrate how
various licenses fit into licensors' overall strategies. You can also
[read case studies](http://thepowerofopen.org/) of others who are using
CC licenses. The CC community can also respond to questions, and may
have already addressed issues you raise. The CC community [email
discussion lists](https://creativecommons.org/discuss) and discussion
archives may be useful resources.

Finally, you may also want to [consult with a
lawyer](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-creative-commons-give-legal-advice-about-its-licenses-or-other-tools-or-help-with-cc-license-enforcement)
to obtain advice on the best license for your needs.

<span id="Why_should_I_use_the_latest_version_.28currently_3.0.29_of_the_Creative_Commons_licenses"></span>

#### Why should I use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses?

The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses is version 4.0. You
should always use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses in
order to take advantage of the many improvements described on the
[license versions page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License%20Versions). In particular, 4.0
is meant to be better suited to international use, and use in many
different contexts, including [sharing data](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data%20FAQ).

<span id="What_if_CC_licenses_have_not_been_ported_to_my_jurisdiction_.28country.29"></span>

#### What if CC licenses have not been ported to my jurisdiction?

All CC licenses are intended to work worldwide. Unless you have a
specific reason to use a [ported
license](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#should-i-choose-an-international-license-or-a-ported-license),
we suggest you consider using one of the international licenses. 4.0
will support official translations of the international license for
those who wish to use the licenses in another language.

As of version 4.0, CC is discouraging ported versions, and has placed a
hold on new porting projects following its publication until sometime in
2014. At that point, CC will reevaluate the necessity of porting in the
future.

#### Should I choose an international license or a ported license?

We recommend that you use a version 4.0 international license. This is
the most up-to-date version of our licenses, drafted after broad
consultation with our global network of affiliates, and it has been
written to be internationally valid. There are currently no
[ports](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-the-international-unported-creative-commons-licenses-and-why-does-cc-offer-ported-licenses)
of 4.0, and it is planned that few, if any, will be created.

All of the ported licenses are at version 3.0 or earlier, which means
licensors using those licenses do not have the benefit of the
[improvements made in the 4.0 license
suite](License_versions "wikilink"). But even before considering the
improvements in 4.0, there are several reasons why the [international
licenses](#What_are_the_international_.28.E2.80.9Cunported.E2.80.9D.29_Creative_Commons_licenses.2C_and_why_does_CC_offer_.E2.80.9Cported.E2.80.9D_licenses "wikilink")
may be preferable for rights holders, even if the licenses have been
ported to their jurisdiction. As an organization, CC itself licenses all
of its own content under an international license because, among other
reasons, the international licenses are essentially jurisdiction-neutral
while remaining effective globally. The neutral nature of the
international licenses appeals to many people and organizations,
particularly for use in connection with global projects that transcend
political borders. Finally, it is important to know that some of the
ported licenses contain a choice of law provision, which may be
undesirable for your needs.

However, some rights holders still choose a license ported to their
local jurisdiction because they believe their needs are not sufficiently
met by the international licenses. If the licenses have been ported to
your jurisdiction and you feel that the ported licenses better account
for some aspect of local legislation, then you may wish to consider a
ported license.

You can [use our jurisdiction
database](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction%20Database) to compare international
licenses and ports on these issues and others, such as whether a ported
license contains a choice of law or forum selection clause.

#### Why should I use the license chooser? What if I don’t?

Licensors are not required to use the [CC license
chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) or provide any information
about themselves or their material when applying a CC license to their
material. However, using the license chooser enables licensors to take
advantage of the "machine readable" layer of CC licenses. Our
[machine-readable](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL) code enhances the discoverability
of your work because that code allows software, search engines, and
other tools to recognize when something is licensed under a CC license.
The code also facilitates attribution: when users click on the CC button
placed on your site, they will be linked directly to HTML code that they
can cut and paste to provide attribution.

<span id="How_do_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons.C2.AE_license_to_my_work"></span>
<span id="Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_an_offline_work"></span>
<span id="How_do_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_my_work"></span>

#### How do I apply a Creative Commons license to my material?

**For online material**: Select the license that is appropriate for your
material [from the CC license
chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) and then follow the
[instructions](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#How_to_use_the_CC_License_Chooser)
to include the HTML code. The code will automatically generate a
[license button](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-do-the-creative-commons-buttons-do)
and a statement that your material is licensed under a CC license. If
you are only licensing part of a work (for example, if you have created
a video under a CC license but are using a song under a different
license), be sure to clearly [mark](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license) which
parts are under the CC license and which parts are not. The HTML code
will also include metadata, which allows the material to be discovered
via [Creative Commons-enabled search
engines](http://search.creativecommons.org/).

**For offline material**: Identify which license you wish to apply to
your work and either (a) [mark your
work](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Example:_Offline_document)
with a statement such as, “This work is licensed under the Creative
Commons [insert description] License. To view a copy of the license,
visit [insert url]"; or (b) insert the applicable [license
buttons](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-do-the-creative-commons-buttons-do) with
the same statement and URL link.

**For third-party platforms**: Many [media
platforms](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Content-sharing_platforms)
like [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/),
[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), and
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) have built-in Creative Commons
capabilities, letting users mark their material with a CC license
through their account settings. The benefit of using this functionality
is that it allows other people to find your content when [searching on
those platforms for CC-licensed
material](http://search.creativecommons.org/). If the platform where
you're uploading your content does not support CC licensing, you can
still identify your content as CC-licensed in the text description of
your content.

Legally, these three options are the same. The only difference between
applying a CC license offline rather than online is that marking a work
online with metadata will ensure that users will be able to find it
through CC-enabled search engines.

CC offers resources on the [best practices for marking your
material](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license) and on [how to mark material in
different media
(.pdf)](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/6/61/Creativecommons-licensing-and-marking-your-content_eng.pdf).

<span id="Does_it_cost_me_anything_to_use_the_Creative_Commons_licenses_.26_tools"></span>

#### Do I need to register with Creative Commons before I obtain a license?

No. CC offers its licenses, code, and tools to the public free of
charge, without obligation. You do not need to register with Creative
Commons to apply a CC license to your material; it is legally valid as
soon as you apply it to any material you have the legal right to
license.

CC does not require or provide any means for creators or other rights
holders to register use of a CC license, [nor does CC maintain a
database of
works](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-creative-commons-collect-or-track-material-licensed-under-a-cc-license)
distributed under Creative Commons licenses. CC also does not require
registration of the work with a national copyright agency.

<span id="Should_I_use_Creative_Commons_licenses_for_software_documentation"></span>
<span id="Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_for_software"></span>

#### What do the terms and conditions of a CC license apply to?

Although CC licenses get attached to tangible works (such as photos and
novels), the license terms and conditions apply to the licensor’s
[copyright](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#how-do-cc-licenses-operate) in the
licensed material. The public is granted “permission to exercise” those
rights in [any medium or
format](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it-in-a-different-format).
It is the expression that is protected by copyright and covered by the
licenses, not any particular medium or format in which the expression is
manifested. This means, for example, that a CC license [applied to a
digitized
copy](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-cc-license-to-low-resolution-copies-of-a-licensed-work-and-reserve-more-rights-in-high-resolution-copies)
of a novel grants the public permission under copyright to use a print
version of the same novel on the same terms and conditions (though you
may have to purchase the print version from a bookstore).

#### Can I apply a Creative Commons license to software?

We recommend against using Creative Commons licenses for software.
Instead, we strongly encourage you to use one of the very good software
licenses which are already available. We recommend considering [licenses
listed as free](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicenses) by
the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) and [listed as “open
source”](http://opensource.org/licenses) by the [Open Source
Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/).

Unlike software-specific licenses, CC licenses do not contain specific
terms about the distribution of source code, which is often important to
ensuring the free reuse and modifiability of software. Many software
licenses also address patent rights, which are important to software but
may not be applicable to other copyrightable works. Additionally, our
licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses,
so it would be difficult to integrate CC-licensed work with other free
software. Existing software licenses were designed specifically for use
with software and offer a similar set of rights to the Creative Commons
licenses.

Version 4.0 of CC's Attribution-ShareAlike (BY-SA) license is [one-way
compatible](https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses) with the [GNU
General Public License version
3.0](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (GPLv3). This compatibility
mechanism is designed for situations in which content is integrated into
software code in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to
distinguish the two. There are special considerations required before
using this compatibility mechanism. Read more about it
[here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/ShareAlike_compatibility:_GPLv3).

Also, the CC0 Public Domain Dedication **is** GPL-compatible and
acceptable for software. For details, [see the relevant CC0 FAQ
entry](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F).

While we recommend against using a CC license on software itself, CC
licenses may be used for software documentation, as well as for separate
artistic elements such as game art or music.

<span id="Can_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_data_or_a_database"></span>

#### Can I apply a Creative Commons license to databases?

Yes. CC licenses [can be used on
databases](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases ).
In the 4.0 license suite, applicable [sui generis database
rights](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights ) are
licensed under the same license conditions as copyright. Many
[governments and others use CC
licenses](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data_and_CC_licenses) for data and databases.

For more detailed information about how CC licenses apply to data and
databases, visit our detailed [Data FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data ).

#### Could I use a CC license to share my logo or trademark?

Creative Commons does not recommend using a CC license on a logo or
trademark. While a logo or trademark can be covered by copyright laws in
addition to trademark laws, the special purposes of trademarks make CC
licenses an unsuitable mechanism for sharing them in most cases.
Generally, logos and trademarks are used to identify the origin of a
product or service, or to indicate that it meets a specific standard or
quality. Allowing anyone to reuse or modify your logo or trademark as a
matter of copyright could result in your inability to limit use of your
logo or trademark selectively to accomplish those purposes. Applying a
CC license to your trademarks and logos could even result in a loss of
your trademark rights altogether. See
[below](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-offer-material-under-a-cc-license-that-has-my-trademark-on-it-without-also-licensing-or-affecting-rights-in-the-trademark )
for more about how to license material that includes a trademark or
logo.

There are other ways to share your logos and trademarks widely while
preserving your trademark rights. Establishing a trademark policy that
grants permissions in advance for limited uses is one common
alternative.
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html),
[Wikimedia](http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Trademark_policy), and
[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/policies) have each
published policies that accomplish the dual objectives of encouraging
reuse and preserving trademark rights.

<span id="May_I_apply_a_Creative_Commons_license_to_a_work_that_is_in_the_public_domain"></span>
<span id="Will_works_that_use_Creative_Commons_licenses_be_in_the_.22public_domain.22"></span>

#### May I apply a Creative Commons license to a work in the public domain?

CC licenses should not be applied to works in the worldwide [public
domain](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-the-public-domain ). All CC
licenses are clear that they [do not have the
effect](http://creativecommons.org/faq/#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use)
of placing restrictions on material that would otherwise be unrestricted, and
you cannot remove a work from the public domain by applying a CC license to it.
If you want to dedicate your own work to the public domain before the
expiration of applicable copyright or similar rights, use CC's legally robust
[public domain
dedication](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). If
a work is already in the worldwide public domain, you should mark it with CC's
[Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/about/pdm).

Note that, in some cases, a work may be in the public domain under the
copyright laws of some jurisdictions but not others. For example, U.S.
government works are in the public domain under the copyright law of the
United States, but may be protected by copyright laws in other
jurisdictions. A CC license applied to such a work would be effective
(and the license restrictions enforceable) in jurisdictions where
copyright protection exists, but would not be operative if U.S.
copyright law is determined to be the applicable law.

Creators may also apply Creative Commons licenses to material they
create that are adapted from public domain works, or to remixed
material, databases, or collections that include work in the public
domain. However, in each of these instances, the license does not affect
parts of the work that are unrestricted by copyright or similar rights.
We strongly encourage you to [mark the public domain
material](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Creators/Marking_third_party_content ), so
that others know they are also free to use this material without legal
restriction.

<span id="If_I_take_a_photograph_of_another_work_that_is_out_of_copyright_and_in_the_public_domain,_can_I_apply_a_CC_license_to_my_photo"></span>

#### If I take a photograph of another work that is in the public domain, can I apply a CC license to my photo?

That depends. You can apply a CC license to your photograph if your
photograph constitutes a work of original authorship, a question that
varies by jurisdiction. As a general matter, your photograph must
involve some creative choices, such as background setting, lighting,
angle, or other mark of creativity. In the United States, an exact
photographic copy of a public domain work is not subject to copyright
because there is no originality (even if there is effort or “sweat”
exerted in its creation).

In practice, if your photograph is sufficiently creative to attract
copyright protection, people will likely have to comply with the license
conditions if they reproduce your entire photograph in verbatim form,
absent some applicable exception or limitation such as fair use.
However, [they would not have to comply with the license conditions if
they reproduce only those parts of the work in the public
domain](#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions "wikilink").
This is because your copyright in the adaptation only extends to the
material you contributed, not to the underlying work.

#### May I apply a CC license to my work if it incorporates material used under fair use or another exception or limitation to copyright?

Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material
you incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license
applies to that material. The CC license only applies to the rights you
have in the work. For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a
Flickr image you are using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify
that image as not being subject to the CC license. For more information
about incorporating work owned by others, see our page about [marking
third party
content](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Creators/Marking_third_party_content "wikilink"). Read
more considerations for licensors
[here](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees "wikilink").

### Rights other than copyright

#### Can I use CC licenses to license rights other than copyright?

CC licenses are copyright licenses, but the latest version of CC
licenses also cover certain other rights similar to copyright, including
[performance, broadcast, and sound recording
rights](#what-are-neighboring-rights "wikilink"),
as well as [sui generis database
rights](#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights "wikilink"). You may
apply a 4.0 license to material subject to any of those rights, whether
or not the material is also subject to copyright. Note that the scope of
prior versions of CC licenses was more limited. You should refer to our
[license versions page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions "wikilink") for details.

#### How do Creative Commons licenses affect my moral rights, if at all?

As a general matter, all CC licenses preserve [moral
rights](#What_are_moral_rights "wikilink") to the extent they exist
(they do not exist everywhere), but allow uses of the work in ways
contemplated by the license that might otherwise violate moral rights.
If you apply a 4.0 license to your material, you agree to waive or not
assert any moral rights you have, to the limited extent necessary to
allow the public to exercise the licensed rights. This is designed to
minimize the effect of moral rights on licensees’ ability to use the
work, and ensure that the license works internationally as intended. The
attribution requirement contained in all of our licenses is intended to
satisfy the moral right of attribution, but it must be adhered to
whether or not the applicable jurisdiction recognizes moral rights.

[Earlier versions](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions "wikilink") of the license are also
intended to minimize the effect of moral rights on otherwise-permitted
uses, but the language in the licenses differs. Additionally,
jurisdiction ports of earlier versions of CC licenses often contain
versions of the moral rights language designed to account for moral
rights legislation in a particular jurisdiction. If you are applying a
ported license to your work, you may wish to review the moral rights
language in the particular license.

You can also [compare how different jurisdictions have implemented this
provision](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction_Database "wikilink"), or [browse the license
versions page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions "wikilink") to compare the treatment of
this issue across the different versions of the CC licenses.

<span id="Can_I_place_a_trademark_on_a_work_and_offer_the_work_under_a_CC_license_without_also_licensing_or_otherwise_affecting_rights_in_the_trademark_If_so.2C_how"></span>

#### Can I offer material under a CC license that has my trademark on it without also licensing or affecting rights in the trademark?

Yes, you may offer material under a Creative Commons license that
includes a trademark indicating the source of the work without affecting
rights in the trademark, because trademark rights are not licensed by
the CC licenses. However, applying the CC license may create an implied
license to use the trademark in connection with the licensed material,
although not in ways that require permission under trademark law. To
avoid any uncertainty, Creative Commons recommends that licensors who
wish to mark material with trademarks or other branding materials give
notice to licensors expressly disclaiming application of the license to
those elements. This can be done in the copyright notice, but could also
be noted on the website where the work is published.

The following is an example notice:

“*The text of and illustrations in this document are licensed by Red Hat
under a Creative Commons Attribution–Share Alike 3.0 Unported license
("CC-BY-SA"). . . . Red Hat, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Shadowman
logo, JBoss, MetaMatrix, Fedora, the Infinity Logo, and RHCE are
trademarks of Red Hat, Inc., registered in the United States and other
countries. For guidelines on the permitted uses of the Fedora
trademarks, refer to
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Trademark_guidelines>.*”

#### How are publicity, privacy, and personality rights affected when I apply a CC license?

When you apply the latest version (4.0) of a CC license to your
material, you also agree to waive or not assert any [publicity, privacy,
or personality
rights](#what-are-publicity-personality-and-privacy-rights "wikilink")
that you hold in the material you are licensing, to the limited extent
necessary for others to exercise the licensed rights. For example, if
you have licensed a photograph of yourself, you may not assert your
right of privacy to have the photo removed from further distribution.
(Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, this is implied but not explicit.)
If you do not wish to license these rights in this way, you should not
apply a CC license to the material where this is a concern.

If there are any third parties who may have publicity, privacy, or
personality rights that apply, those rights are not affected by your
application of a CC license, and a reuser must seek permission for
relevant uses. If you are aware of any such third party rights in the
material you are licensing, we recommend [marking the
material](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Noting_third-party_content_in_your_work "wikilink") to
give notice to reusers.

### Business models

<span id="I_am_a_member_of_a_collecting_society.2C_can_I_use_Creative_Commons_licenses"></span>

#### Can I apply a CC license to low-resolution copies of a licensed work and reserve more rights in high-resolution copies?

You may license your copyright or distribute your work under more than
one set of terms. For example, you may publish a photograph on your
website, but only distribute high-resolution copies to people who have
paid for access. This is a practice CC supports. However, if the
low-resolution and high-resolution copies are the [same work under
applicable copyright
law](#how-do-i-know-if-a-low-resolution-photo-and-a-high-resolution-photo-are-the-same-work "wikilink"),
permission under a CC license is not limited to a particular copy, and
someone who receives a copy in high resolution may use it under the
terms of the CC license applied to the low-resolution copy.

Note that, although CC [strongly discourages the
practice](#can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work "wikilink"),
CC cannot prevent licensors from attempting to impose restrictions
through separate agreements on uses the license otherwise would allow.
In that case, licensees may be [contractually
restricted](#what-if-i-have-received-cc-licensed-material-with-additional-restrictions "wikilink")
from using the high-resolution copy, for example, even if the licensor
has placed a CC license on the low-resolution copy.

#### Can I use a Creative Commons license if I am a member of a collecting society?

Creators and other rights holders may wish to check with their
[collecting society](#what-are-collecting-societies "wikilink")
before applying a CC license to their material. Many rights holders who
are members of a collecting society can waive the right to collect
royalties for uses allowed under the license, but only to the extent
their societies allow.

Collecting societies in several countries including Australia, Finland,
France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Taiwan, and the Netherlands
take an assignment of rights from creators in present and future works
and manage them, so that the societies effectively become the owner of
these rights. (In France it is called a “mandate” of rights but has
similar practical effect.) Creators in these jurisdictions who belong to
collecting societies may not be able to license their material under CC
licenses because the collecting societies own the necessary rights, not
the creators. CC is [working with several collecting
societies](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Collecting_Society_Projects "wikilink") and running pilot
programs that allow creators to use CC licenses in some circumstances.

If you are already a member of a collecting society and want to use CC
licenses, you are welcome to encourage your collecting society to give
you the option of Creative Commons licensing.

#### Can I still make money from a work I make available under a Creative Commons license?

Yes. One of our goals is to encourage creators and rights holders to
experiment with new ways to promote and market their work. There are
several possible ways of doing this.

CC's [NonCommercial
(NC)](#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses "wikilink")
licenses allow rights holders to maximize distribution while maintaining
control of the commercialization of their works. If you want to reserve
the right to commercialize your work, you may do this by choosing a
license with the NC condition. If someone else wants to use your work
commercially and you have applied an NC license to your work, they must
first get your permission. As the rights holder, you may still sell your
own work commercially.

You may also use funding models that do not depend on using an NC
license. For example, many artists and creators use crowdfunding to fund
their work before releasing it under a less restrictive license. Others
use a “freemium” model where the basic content is free, but extras such
as a physical printed version or special access to a members-only
website are for paying customers only.

For more information and ideas, [The Power of
Open](http://thepowerofopen.org/) presents case studies of artists,

### Alterations and additions to the license

<span id="Can_I_insist_on_the_exact_placement_of_the_attribution_credit_for_my_work"></span>

#### Can I insist on the exact placement of the attribution credit?

No. CC licenses allow for flexibility in the way credit is provided
depending on the medium, means, and context in which a licensee is
redistributing licensed material. For example, providing attribution to
the creator when using licensed material in a blog post may be different
than doing so in a video remix. This flexibility facilitates compliance
by licensees and reduces uncertainty about different types of
reuse—minimizing the risk that overly onerous and inflexible attribution
requirements are simply disregarded.

<span id="Can_I_change_the_terms_of_a_CC_license_or_waive_some_of_its_conditions"></span>

#### Can I change the license terms or conditions?

Yes—but if you change the terms and conditions of any Creative Commons
license, you *must no longer call, label, or describe the license as a
“Creative Commons” or “CC” license*, nor can you use the [Creative
Commons logos, buttons, or other
trademarks](https://creativecommons.org/policies) in connection with the
modified license or your materials. Keep in mind that altering terms and
conditions is distinct from [waiving existing conditions or granting
additional
permissions](#Can_I_waive_license_terms_or_conditions "wikilink")
than those in the licenses. Licensors may always do so, and many choose
to do so using the [CC+ protocol](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus "wikilink") to readily signal
the waiver or additional permission on the CC license deed.

CC does not assert copyright in the text of its licenses, so you are
permitted to modify the text as long as you do not use the CC marks to
describe it. However, we do not recommend this. We also advise against
[modifying our licenses](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Modifying_the_CC_licenses "wikilink") through
indirect means, such as in your terms of service. A modified license
very likely will not be compatible with the same CC license (unmodified)
applied to other material. This would prevent licensees from using,
combining, or remixing content under your customized license with other
content under the same or compatible CC licenses.

Modifying licenses creates friction that confuses users and undermines
the key benefits of public, standardized licenses. Central to our
licenses is the grant of a standard set of permissions in advance,
without requiring users to ask for permission or seek clarification
before using the work. This encourages sharing and facilitates reuse,
since everyone knows what to expect and the burden of negotiating
permissions on a case by case basis is eliminated.

#### Can I waive license terms or conditions?

Yes. You may always choose to waive some license terms or conditions.
Material licensed under a CC license but with additional permissions
granted or conditions waived may be compatibly licensed with other
material under the same license. Our [CC+ protocol](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CCPlus "wikilink")
provides a mechanism for facilitating that grant or waiver.

<span id="Can_I_enter_into_separate_agreements_or_understandings_with_users_outside_the_scope_of_the_license"></span>

#### Can I enter into separate or supplemental agreements with users of my work?

Yes. CC licenses are nonexclusive. Licensors always have the option of
entering into separate arrangements for the sharing of their material in
addition to applying a CC license. However, those different arrangements
are not “CC” or “Creative Commons” licenses.

**Separate agreements:** You may offer the licensed material under other
licenses in addition to the CC license (a practice commonly referred to
as "dual licensing"). For example, you may wish to license a video game
soundtrack under both a CC license and the GPL, so that it may be used
under either set of terms. A reuser may then choose which set of terms
to comply with. Or, for example, you may offer your material to the
public under a NonCommercial license, but offer commercial permissions
to fee-paying customers.

**Supplemental agreements:** Problems arise when licensors design those
terms or arrangements to serve not as separate, alternative licensing
arrangements but as supplemental terms [having the effect of changing
the standard terms within the CC
license](#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions "wikilink").
While you may offer separate terms and conditions to other parties, you
should not do so in such a way that would neutralize terms of the CC
license.

Except in the limited situation where [more permissions are being
granted or license conditions are
waived](#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions "wikilink"),
if the additional arrangement modifies or conflicts with the CC license
terms, then the resulting licensing arrangement is no longer a CC
licensing arrangement. To avoid confusing those who may mistakenly
believe the work is licensed under standard CC terms, we must insist
that in these instances licensors not use our [trademarks, names, and
logos](https://creativecommons.org/policies) in connection with their
custom licensing arrangement.

It should be noted that any agreements you make with other parties only
have an effect on the other parties to that agreement, and do not apply
to anyone else receiving the licensed material. For example, if there
are terms of use that apply to visitors to your website on which you
host CC-licensed material, your terms of use may apply to visitors to
that website, but not to anyone who receives copies of the CC-licensed
material elsewhere. Even for the visitors to your website, any separate
terms and conditions do not become part of the license—they remain a
separate contractual agreement, and violation of this agreement does not
constitute copyright infringement.

### After licensing

<span id="What_happens_if_someone_misuses_my_Creative_Commons-licensed_work"></span>
<span id="What_happens_if_I_offer_my_work_under_a_Creative_Commons_license_and_someone_misuses_my_work"></span>

#### What happens if I offer my material under a Creative Commons license and someone misuses them?

A CC license [terminates
automatically](#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back "wikilink")
when its conditions are violated. For example, if a reuser of
CC-licensed material does not provide the attribution required when
sharing the work, then the user no longer has the right to continue
using the material and may be liable for copyright infringement. The
license is terminated for the user who violated the license. However,
all other users still have a valid license, so long as they are in
compliance.

Under the 4.0 licenses, a licensee automatically gets these rights back
if she fixes the violation within 30 days of discovering it.

If you apply a Creative Commons license and a user violates the license
conditions, you may opt to contact the person directly to ask them to
rectify the situation or consult a lawyer to act on your behalf.
Creative Commons is not a law firm and cannot represent you or give you
legal advice, but there are [lawyers who have identified themselves as
interested in representing people in CC-related
matters](#Can_Creative_Commons_give_legal_advice_about_its_licenses_or_other_tools.2C_or_help_with_CC_license_enforcement.3F "wikilink").

<span id="What_can_I_do_if_I_offer_my_work_under_a_Creative_Commons_license_and_I_do_not_like_the_way_someone_uses_my_work"></span>

#### What can I do if I offer my material under a Creative Commons license and I do not like the way someone uses it?

As long as users abide by license terms and conditions, licensors cannot
control how the material is used. However, CC licenses do provide
several mechanisms that allow licensors to choose not to be associated
with their material or to uses of their material with which they
disagree.

First, all CC licenses [prohibit using the attribution requirement to
suggest that the licensor endorses or supports a particular
use](#do-i-need-to-be-aware-of-anything-else-when-providing-attribution "wikilink").
Second, licensors may waive the attribution requirement, choosing not to
be identified as the licensor, if they wish. Third, if the licensor does
not like how the material has been modified or used, CC licenses require
that the licensee [remove the attribution information upon
request](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Licensors_may_request_removal_of_attribution ).
(In 3.0 and earlier, this is only a requirement for adaptations and
collections; in 4.0, this also applies to the unmodified work.) Finally,
anyone modifying licensed material must [indicate that the original has
been
modified](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Modifications_and_adaptations_must_be_indicated "wikilink").
This ensures that changes made to the original material--whether or not
the licensor approves of them--are not attributed back to the licensor.

<span id="What_do_I_do_if_someone_tries_to_restrict_my_work_with_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29"></span>

#### What do I do if someone tries to place effective technological measures (such as DRM) on my CC-licensed material?

The use of [any effective technical protection measures (such as digital
rights management or
"DRM")](#can-i-use-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-when-i-share-cc-licensed-material )
by licensees to prevent others from exercising the licensed rights is
prohibited.

Not all kinds of encryption or [access
limitations](#can-i-share-cc-licensed-material-on-password-protected-sites "wikilink")
are prohibited by the licenses. For example, sending content via email
and encrypting it with the recipient's public key does not restrict use
of the work by the recipient. Likewise, limiting recipients to a
particular set of users (for example, by requiring a username and
password to enter a site) does not restrict further use of the content
by the recipients. In these examples, these things do not prevent the
recipient from exercising all of the rights granted by the license,
including the right to redistribute it further.

If someone is applying effective technological measures to your
CC-licensed material that do restrict exercise of the licensed rights
(such as applying DRM that restricts copying), this is a violation of
the license terms unless you have chosen to grant this permission
separately.

#### When I release my work under a CC license in one format (e.g., .pdf), can I restrict licensees from changing it to or using it in other formats?

No. CC licenses grant permission to use the licensed material in any
media or format regardless of the format in which it has been made
available. This is true even if you have applied a NoDerivatives license
to your work. Once a CC license is applied to a work in one format or
medium, a licensee may use the same work in any other format or medium
without violating the licensor’s copyright.

<span id="What_if_I_change_my_mind"></span>

#### What if I change my mind about using a CC license?

CC licenses are not revocable. Once something has been published under a
CC license, licensees may continue using it according to the license
terms for the duration of applicable copyright and similar rights. As a
licensor, you may stop distributing under the CC license at any time,
but anyone who has access to a copy of the material may continue to
redistribute it under the CC license terms. While you cannot revoke the
license, CC licenses do provide a
[mechanism](#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it "wikilink")
for licensors to ask that others using their material remove the
attribution information. You should [think carefully before choosing a
Creative Commons
license](Considerations for licensors and licensees "wikilink").

## For Licensees

### Before using CC-licensed material

<span id="How_do_I_use_a_Creative_Commons-licensed_work"></span>
<span id="What_should_I_think_about_before_using_a_work_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license"></span>

#### What should I think about before using material offered under a Creative Commons license?

CC offers [six core licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/),
each of which grants a different set of permissions. Before you use
CC-licensed material, [you should review the terms of the particular
license](https://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/) to be sure your
anticipated use is permitted. If you wish to use the work in a manner
that is not permitted by the license, you should contact the rights
holder (often the creator) to get permission first, or look for an
alternative work that is licensed in a way that permits your anticipated
use. Note that if you use material in a way that is not permitted by the
applicable license and your use is not otherwise permitted by an
applicable copyright exception or limitation, the license is
[automatically
terminated](#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back "wikilink")
and you may be liable for copyright infringement, even if you are
eligible to have your rights reinstated later.

Before using material offered under a Creative Commons license, you
should know that [CC licenses only grant permissions needed under
copyright and similar
rights](#does-a-creative-commons-license-give-me-all-the-rights-i-need-to-use-the-work "wikilink"),
and there may be additional rights you need to use it as intended. You
should also understand that licensors do not offer warranties or
guarantees about the material they are licensing unless expressly
indicated otherwise. All materials are licensed "AS IS" and a disclaimer
of warranties applies unless expressly provided otherwise. If you want
to ask for a warranty or guarantee about rights to use the material, you
should talk with the licensor before using it.

<span id="Does_using_a_Creative_Commons-licensed_work_give_me_all_the_rights_I_need"></span>

#### Does a Creative Commons license give me all the rights I need to use the work?

It depends. CC licenses do not license rights other than copyright and
[similar
rights](#can-i-use-cc-licenses-to-license-rights-other-than-copyright "wikilink")
(which include [sui generis database
rights](#what-are-sui-generis-database-rights "wikilink") in version
4.0). For example, they do not license trademark or patent rights, or
the [publicity, personality, and privacy
rights](#what-are-publicity-personality-and-privacy-rights "wikilink")
of third parties. However, licensors agree to waive or not assert any
[moral rights](#what-are-moral-rights "wikilink"), publicity rights,
personality rights, or privacy rights they themselves hold, to the
limited extent necessary to allow exercise of the licensed rights. Any
rights outside of the scope of the license may require clearance (i.e.,
permission) in order to use the work as you would like.

Additionally, creative works sometimes incorporate works owned by others
(known as "third party content"), often used pursuant to a CC license or
under an exception or limitation to copyright such as fair use in the
U.S. You should make sure you have permission to use any third party
content contained in the work you want to use, or that your use is
otherwise allowed under the laws of your jurisdiction, particularly in
cases such as fair use where your right to use the content depends on
the particular context in which you plan to use it.

All CC licenses contain a disclaimer of warranties, meaning that the
licensor is not guaranteeing anything about the work, including whether
she owns the copyright, has received permission to include third-party
content within her work, or secured other rights such as through the use
of model releases if a person's image is used in the work. You [may wish
to obtain legal
advice](#can-creative-commons-give-legal-advice-about-its-licenses-or-other-tools-or-help-with-cc-license-enforcement "wikilink")
before using CC-licensed material if you are not sure whether you have
all the rights you need.

#### What if there are sui generis database rights that apply to my use of a CC-licensed database?

In the somewhat limited circumstances where sui generis database rights
apply to your use, special conditions apply and there are more specific
considerations you should be aware of. Under 4.0, sui generis database
rights are licensed alongside copyright, but the treatment in earlier
versions of the license varies. A fuller explanation of these variations
and related considerations is available in the [Data
FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/data "wikilink").

#### Where can I find material offered under a CC license?

If you are looking for material offered under a Creative Commons
license, [CC Search](http://search.creativecommons.org/) is a good
starting point. There is also a
[directory](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Content_Directories "wikilink") of organizations and
individuals who use CC licenses. Some media sites, such as
[Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), have search filters for material
licensed using CC's licenses.

Be sure to confirm that the material you want to use is actually under a
CC license, as search results may sometimes be misleading.

<span id="So_I_don.E2.80.99t_have_to_pay_to_use_Creative_Commons-licensed_works_if_I_comply_with_the_license_terms"></span>

#### Are Creative Commons works really free to use?

Yes. While many if not most CC-licensed works are available at no cost,
some licensors charge for initial access to CC-licensed works—for
example, by publishing CC-licensed content only to subscribers, or by
charging for downloads. However, even if you have paid an access charge,
once you have a copy of CC-licensed material, you may make any further
uses permitted by the license without paying licensing fees.

(If you wish to make uses that are not permitted by the license—for
example, making a [commercial
use](#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses "wikilink")
of an NC-licensed photo—the licensor may charge for those additional
rights.)

#### What should I know about differences between the international licenses and the ported licenses?

As a licensee, you should always read and understand the relevant
license's legal code before using CC-licensed material, particularly if
you are using material that is licensed using a [ported
license](#what-are-the-international-unported-creative-commons-licenses-and-why-does-cc-offer-ported-licenses "wikilink")
with which you are unfamiliar. Our porting process involved adapting the
international licenses to the legal framework of different
jurisdictions, and in that process slight adjustments may have been made
that you should make yourself aware of in advance of using the material.
You can find more information about the ported licenses in the
[Jurisdiction Database](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Jurisdiction_Database "wikilink").

There are currently no ported versions of 4.0, and we expect there will
be few, if any, in the future. All official translations of the 4.0
international licenses are equivalent: you may substitute one for
another depending on your preferred language.

However, the ported versions of 3.0 and earlier sometimes contain small
differences from the international license depending on the ways in
which they have been adapted to their jurisdictions. For example, a
handful of the ported licenses contain provisions specifying which laws
will apply in the event the licensor chooses to enforce the license, and
a few of the ported licenses contain forum selection clauses.

### General license compliance

<span id="What_happens_if_I_want_to_make_a_different_use_of_the_work"></span>
<span id="What_happens_if_I_want_to_use_the_work_in_a_way_that_is_not_permitted_by_the_license"></span>

#### What happens if I want to use the material in a way that is not permitted by the license?

Contact the rights holders to ask for permission. Otherwise, [unless an
exception or limitation to copyright
applies](#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions "wikilink"),
your use of the material may violate the Creative Commons license. If
you violate the terms of the license, your rights to use the material
will be [automatically
terminated](#how-can-i-lose-my-rights-under-a-creative-commons-license-if-that-happens-how-do-i-get-them-back "wikilink"),
and you may be liable for copyright infringement.

#### Do I always have to comply with the license terms? If not, what are the exceptions?

You need to comply with the license terms if what you are doing would
otherwise require permission from the rights holder. If your use would
not require permission from the rights holder because it falls under an
exception or limitation, such as fair use, or because the material has
come into the public domain, the license does not apply, and you do not
need to comply with its terms and conditions. Additionally, if you are
using an excerpt small enough to be uncopyrightable, the license does
not apply to your use, and you do not need to comply with its terms.

However, if you are using excerpts of CC-licensed material which
individually are minimal and do not require license compliance, but
together make up a significant copyrightable chunk, you must comply with
the license terms. For example, if you quote many individual lines from
a poem across several sections of a blog post, and your use is not a
fair use, you must comply with the license even though no individual
line would have been a substantial enough portion of the work to require
this.

### Attribution

<span id="How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work"></span>
<span id="How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_work_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license"></span>

#### How do I properly attribute material offered under a Creative Commons license?

All CC licenses require users to attribute the creator of licensed
material, unless the creator has [waived that
requirement](#can-i-waive-license-terms-or-conditions "wikilink"),
not supplied a name, or [asked that her name be
removed](#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it "wikilink").
Additionally, you must retain a copyright notice, a link to the license
(or to the deed), a license notice, a notice about the disclaimer of
warranties, and a URI if reasonable. For versions prior to 4.0, you must
also provide the title of the work. (Though it is not a requirement in
4.0, it is still recommended if one is supplied.)

You must also indicate if you have [modified the
work](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Modifications_and_adaptations_must_be_indicated "wikilink")—for
example, if you have taken an excerpt, or cropped a photo. (For versions
prior to 4.0, this is only required if you have created an adaptation by
contributing your own creative material, but it is recommended even when
not required.) It is not necessary to note trivial alterations, such as
correcting a typo or changing a font size. Finally, you must retain an
indication of previous modifications to the work.

CC licenses have a flexible attribution requirement, so there is not
necessarily one correct way to provide attribution. The proper method
for giving credit will depend on the medium and means you are using, and
may be implemented in any reasonable manner. Additionally, you may
satisfy the attribution requirement by providing a link to a place where
the attribution information may be found.

While the attribution requirements in the license are the minimum
requirement, we always recommend that you [follow the best
practices](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution "wikilink") for the kind of use you are making.
For example, if you are using scientific data marked with CC0, you are
not required to give attribution at all, but we recommend that you give
the same credit you would give to any other source—not because the
license requires it, but because that is the standard for letting others
know the source of the data.

The CC website offers some [best practices](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution "wikilink") to
help you attribute properly, and the [CC
Australia](http://www.creativecommons.org.au/) team has developed a
[helpful guide to attributing CC-licensed material
(.pdf)](https://creativecommons.org.au/content/attributingccmaterials.pdf)
in different formats. Note that the attribution and marking requirements
vary slightly among license versions. See [here for a chart comparing
the specific
requirements](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Detailed_attribution_comparison_chart "wikilink").

<span id="Do_I_need_to_be_aware_of_anything_else_when_providing_attribution_or_credit"></span>

#### Do I need to be aware of anything else when providing attribution?

Yes. You need to be careful not to imply any sponsorship, endorsement,
or connection with the licensor or attribution party without their
permission. Wrongfully implying that a creator, publisher, or anyone
else endorses you or your use of a work may be unlawful. Creative
Commons makes the obligation not to imply endorsement explicit in its
licenses. In addition, if the licensor of a work [requests that you
remove the identifying
credit](#what-can-i-do-if-i-offer-my-material-under-a-creative-commons-license-and-i-do-not-like-the-way-someone-uses-it "wikilink"),
you must do so to the extent practical.

Additionally, when you are using a work that is an adaptation of one or
more pre-existing works, you may need to [give credit to the creator(s)
of the pre-existing
work(s)](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license#Noting_third-party_content_in_your_work "wikilink"), in
addition to giving credit to the creator of the adaptation.

#### Do I always have to attribute the creator of the licensed material?

You must attribute the creator when you provide material to the public
by any means that is restricted by copyright or similar rights. If you
are using the material personally but are not making it or any
adaptations of it available to others, you do not have to attribute the
licensor. Similarly, if you are only distributing the material or
adaptations of it within your company or organization, you do not have
to comply with the attribution requirement. Learn
[more](#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions "wikilink")
about when compliance with the license is not required.

### Using licensed material

<span id="So_.E2.80.9CNonCommercial.E2.80.9D_means_that_the_work_cannot_be_used_commercially "></span>
<span id="Is_use_X_a_violation_of_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses"></span>

#### Does my use violate the NonCommercial clause of the licenses?

CC's NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit uses that are "primarily
intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary
compensation." This is intended to capture the intention of the NC-using
community without placing detailed restrictions that are either too
broad or too narrow. Please note that CC's definition does not turn on
the type of user: if you are a nonprofit or charitable organization,
your use of an NC-licensed work could still run afoul of the NC
restriction, and if you are a for-profit entity, your use of an
NC-licensed work does not necessarily mean you have violated the term.
Whether a use is commercial will depend on the specifics of the
situation and the intentions of the user.

In CC's experience, it is usually relatively easy to determine whether a
use is permitted, and known conflicts are relatively few considering the
popularity of the NC licenses. However, there will always be uses that
are challenging to categorize as commercial or noncommercial. CC cannot
advise you on what is and is not commercial use. If you are unsure, you
should either contact the rights holder for clarification, or search for
works that permit commercial uses.

CC has a [brief guide](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation "wikilink") to
interpretation of the NC license that goes into more detail about the
meaning of the NC license and some key points to pay attention to.
Additionally, in 2008, [Creative Commons published
results](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Defining_Noncommercial "wikilink") from a survey on meanings of
commercial and noncommercial use generally. Note that the results of the
study are not intended to serve as CC's official interpretation of what
is and is not commercial use under our licenses, and the results should
not be relied upon as such.

#### Can I take a CC-licensed work and use it in a different format?

Yes. When any of the six CC licenses is applied to material, licensees
are granted permission to use the material as the license allows,
whatever the media or format chosen by the user when it is used or
distributed further. This is true even in our NoDerivatives licenses.
This is one of a very few default rules established in our licenses, to
harmonize what may be different outcomes depending on where CC-licensed
material is reused and what jurisdiction’s copyright law applies.

This means, for example, that even if a creator distributes a work in
digital format, you have permission to print and share a hard copy of
the same work.

<span id="How_do_I_know_if_a_low-resolution_photo_and_a_high-resolution_photo_are_the_same_work"></span>

#### How do I know if a low-resolution photo and a high-resolution photo are the same work?

As with most copyright questions, it will depend on applicable law.
Generally, to be different works under copyright law, there must be
expressive or original choices made that make one work a separate and
distinct work from another. The determination depends on the standards
for copyright in the relevant jurisdiction.

Under U.S. copyright law, for example, mechanical reproduction of a work
into a different format
[is unlikely to create a separate, new work](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp>). Consequently, digitally
enhancing or changing the format of a work *absent some originality*,
such as expressive choices made in the enhancement or encoding, will not
likely create a separate work for copyright purposes. The creative bar
is low, but it is not non-existent. Accordingly, in some jurisdictions
releasing a photograph under a CC license will give the public
permission to reuse the photograph in a different resolution.

#### Can I reuse an excerpt of a larger work that is licensed with the NoDerivs restriction?

The NoDerivs licenses (BY-ND and BY-NC-ND) prohibit reusers from creating adaptations. What constitutes an [adaptation](#when-is-my-use-considered-an-adaptation), otherwise known as a derivative work, varies slightly based on the law of the relevant jurisdiction.

Incorporating an unaltered excerpt from an ND-licensed work into a larger work only creates an adaptation if the larger work can be said to be built upon and derived from the work from which the excerpt was taken. Generally, no derivative work is made of the original from which the excerpt was taken when the excerpt is used to illuminate an idea or provide an example in another larger work. Instead, only the reproduction right of the original copyright holder is being exercised by person reusing the excerpt. All CC licenses grant the right to reproduce a CC-licensed work for noncommercial purposes (at a minimum).   For example, a person could make copies of one chapter of an ND-licensed book and not be in violation of the license so long as other conditions of the license are met.

There are exceptions to that general rule, however, when the excerpts are combined with other material in a way that creates some new version of the original from which the excerpt is taken. For example, if a portion of a song was used as part of a new song, that may rise to the level of creating an adaptation of the original song, even though only a portion of it was used and even if that portion was used as-is.


#### Can I use effective technological measures (such as DRM) when I share CC-licensed material?

No. When you receive material under a Creative Commons license, you may
not place additional terms and conditions on the reuse of the work. This
includes using effective technological measures (ETMs) that would
restrict a licensee’s ability to exercise the licensed rights.

A technological measure is considered an ETM if circumventing it carries
penalties under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO
Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, or similar international
agreements. Generally, this means that the anti-circumvention laws of
various jurisdictions would cover attempts to break it.

For example, if you remix a CC-licensed song, and you wish to share it
on a music site that places digital copy-restriction on all uploaded
files, you may not do this without express permission from the licensor.
However, if you upload that same file to your own site or any other site
that does not apply DRM to the file, and a listener chooses to stream it
through an app that applies DRM, you have not violated the license.

Note that merely converting material into a different format that is
difficult to access or is only available for certain platforms does not
violate the restriction; you may do this without violating the license
terms.

#### Can I share CC-licensed material on password-protected sites?

Yes. This is not considered to be a prohibited measure, so long as the
protection is merely limiting who may access the content, and does not
restrict the authorized recipients from exercising the licensed rights.
For example, you may post material under any CC license on a site
restricted to members of a certain school, or to paying customers, but
[you may not place effective technological measures (including DRM) on
the
files](#can-i-use-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm-when-i-share-cc-licensed-material "wikilink")
that prevents them from sharing the material elsewhere.

(Note that charging for access may not be permitted with NC-licensed
material; however, it is not disallowed by the restriction on ETMs.)

#### Can I share CC-licensed material on file-sharing networks?

Yes. All CC licenses allow redistribution of the unmodified material by
any means, including distribution via file-sharing networks. Note that
file-trading is expressly considered to be noncommercial for purposes of
compliance with the NC licenses. Barter of NC-licensed material for
other items of value is not permitted.

### Additional restrictions on licensed material

#### What if I received CC-licensed material encumbered with effective technological measures (such as DRM)?

If you have received material under a CC license that is encumbered with
effective technological measures (such as digital rights management or
DRM), you may or may not be permitted to break it, depending on the
circumstances. By releasing material under a CC license, the licensor
agrees not to assert any rights she may have to prevent the
circumvention of effective technological measures. (Under the 3.0 and
earlier licenses, this is implied but not explicit.) However, if she has
uploaded it to a site or other distribution channel that itself applies
such measures, that site may have the right to prevent you from breaking
them, even though the licensor herself cannot do so.

Note that anti-circumvention laws can impose criminal liability in some
jurisdictions.

#### What if I have received CC-licensed material with additional restrictions?

It is possible that CC-licensed material will appear on platforms that
impose terms in addition to the copyright license (though [Creative
Commons strongly discourages restrictions that interfere with exercise
of the licensed
rights](#can-i-enter-into-separate-or-supplemental-agreements-with-users-of-my-work "wikilink")).
These additional terms do not form part of the license for the work. For
example, if you download CC-licensed material from a site that does not
permit downloading, you may be breaking the terms of use of the site,
but you are not infringing the CC license. See our guide to [Modifying
the CC licenses](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Modifying_the_CC_licenses "wikilink") for more guidance
and information.

### Combining and adapting CC material

<span id="Does_my_use_constitute_an_adaptation"></span>

#### When is my use considered an adaptation?

Whether a modification of licensed material is considered an
[adaptation](#what-is-an-adaptation "wikilink") for the purpose of CC
licenses depends primarily on the applicable copyright law. Copyright
law reserves to an original creator the right to create adaptations of
the original work. CC licenses that allow for adaptations to be
shared—all except BY-ND and BY-NC-ND—grant permission to others to
create and redistribute adaptations when doing so would otherwise
constitute a violation of applicable copyright law. Generally, a
modification rises to the level of an adaptation under copyright law
when the modified work is based on the prior work but manifests
sufficient new creativity to be copyrightable, such as a translation of
a novel from one language to another, or the creation of a screenplay
based on a novel.

Under CC licenses, synching music in timed relation with a moving image
is always considered an adaptation, whether or not it would be
considered so under applicable law. Also, under version 4.0, certain
uses of databases restricted by sui generis database rights also
constitute adaptations (called "Adapted Material" in the 4.0 licenses),
whether or not they would be considered adaptations under copyright law.
For more details about adaptations in the database context, see the
[Data FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/data "wikilink").

Note that all CC licenses allow the user to exercise the rights
permitted under the license [in any format or
medium](#can-i-take-a-cc-licensed-work-and-use-it-in-a-different-format "wikilink").
Those changes are not considered adaptations even if applicable law
would suggest otherwise. For example, you may redistribute a book that
uses the CC
[BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license in
print form when it was originally distributed online, even if you have
had to make formatting changes to do so, as long as you do so in
compliance with the other terms of the license.

***Note on terminology: throughout these FAQs, we use the term "remix"
interchangeably with “adapt.” Both are designed to mean doing something
that constitutes an [adaptation under copyright
law](#what-is-an-adaptation "wikilink").***

<span id="If_I_use_a_Creative_Commons-licensed_work_with_other_works.2C_do_I_have_to_Creative_Commons_license_everything_else_as_well"></span>
<span id="Can_I_combine_two_different_Creative_Commons_licensed_works_Can_I_combine_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work_with_another_non-CC_licensed_work"></span>
<span id="Can_I_combine_works_that_use_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work"></span>

#### Can I combine material under different Creative Commons licenses in my work?

It depends. The first question to ask is whether doing so constitutes an
[adaptation.](#When_is_my_use_considered_an_adaptation "wikilink")
If the combination does ***not*** create an adaptation, then you may
combine any CC-licensed content so long as you provide attribution and
comply with the NonCommercial restriction if it applies. If you want to
combine material in a way that results in the creation of an adaptation
(i.e. a “remix”), then you must pay attention to the particular license
that applies to the content you want to combine.

The NoDerivatives licenses do not permit remixing except for private use
(the pre-4.0 licenses do not permit remixing at all, except as allowed
by exceptions and limitations to copyright). All the other CC licenses
allow remixes, but may impose limitations or conditions on how the remix
may be used. For example, if you create a remix with material licensed
under a ShareAlike license, you need to make sure that all of the
material contributed to the remix is licensed under the same license or
[one that CC has named as
compatible](https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), and you must
[properly credit all of the sources](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution "wikilink") with the
[required
attribution](#how-do-i-properly-attribute-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license "wikilink")
and license information. Similarly, if you want to use a remix for
[commercial
purposes](#Does_my_use_violate_the_NonCommercial_clause_of_the_licenses "wikilink"),
you cannot incorporate material released under one of the NonCommercial
licenses.

The chart below shows which CC-licensed material can be remixed. To use
the chart, find a license on the left column and on the top right row.
If there is a check mark in the box where that row and column intersect,
then the works can be remixed. If there is an “X” in the box, then the
works may not be remixed unless an exception or limitation applies. See
[below for details on how remixes may be
licensed](#if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use "wikilink").

<span id="If_I_derive_or_adapt_a_work_offered_under_a_Creative_Commons_license.2C_which_CC_license.28s.29_can_I_apply_to_the_resulting_work"></span>

#### If I derive or adapt material offered under a Creative Commons license, which CC license(s) can I use?

If you make
[adaptations](#When_is_my_use_considered_an_adaptation "wikilink")
of material under a CC license (i.e. "remix"), the original CC license
always applies to the material you are adapting even once adapted. The
license you may choose for your own contribution (called your "adapter's
license") depends on which license applies to the original material.
Recipients of the adaptation must comply with both the CC license on the
original and your adapter’s license.

* **BY and BY-NC material**

When remixing BY or BY-NC material, it is generally recommended that
your adapter's license include at least the same license elements as the
license applied to the original material. This eases reuse for
downstream users because they are able to satisfy both licenses by
complying with the adapter's license. For example, if you adapt material
licensed under BY-NC, your adapter's license should also contain the NC
restriction. See the chart below for more details.

* **BY-SA and BY-NC-SA material**

In general, when remixing ShareAlike content, your adapter's license
must be the same license as the license on the material you are
adapting. All licenses after version 1.0 also allow you to license your
contributions under a later version of the same license, and some also
allow ported licenses. (See the [license versions
page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_Versions#Compatibility_mechanism_in_BY-SA_licenses "wikilink")
for details.) If you wish to adapt material under BY-SA or BY-NC-SA and
release your contributions under a non-CC license, you should visit the
[Compatibility page](https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses) to
see which options are allowed.

* **BY-ND and BY-NC-ND material**

The BY-ND and BY-NC-ND licenses do not permit distribution of
adaptations (also known as remixes or derivative works), and prohibits
the creation of adaptations under the pre-4.0 versions of those
licenses. Since you may not share remixes of these materials at all,
there is no compatibility with other licenses. (Note that the ND
licenses do allow you to reproduce the material in unmodified form
together with other material in a collection, as indicated in the next
FAQ.)

* **Adapter's license chart**

The chart below details the CC license(s) you may use as your adapter's
license. When creating an adaptation of material under the license
identified in the lefthand column, you may license your contributions to
the adaptation under one of the licenses indicated on the top row if the
corresponding box is green. CC does not recommend using a license if the
corresponding box is yellow, although doing so is technically permitted
by the terms of the license. If you do, you should take additional care
to mark the adaptation as involving multiple copyrights under different
terms so that downstream users are aware of their obligations to comply
with the licenses from all rights holders. Dark gray boxes indicate
those licenses that you may not use as your adapter's license.

#### If I create a collection that includes a work offered under a CC license, which license(s) may I choose for the collection?

All Creative Commons licenses (including the version 4.0 licenses) allow
licensed material to be included in collections such as anthologies,
encyclopedias, and broadcasts. You may choose a license for the
collection, however this does not change the license applicable to the
original material.

When you include CC-licensed content in a collection, you still must
adhere to the license conditions governing your use of the material
incorporated. For example, material under any of the Creative Commons
NonCommercial licenses cannot be used
[commercially](#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses "wikilink").
The table below indicates what type of CC-licensed works you may
incorporate into collections licensed for commercial and noncommercial
uses.

### License termination

#### When do Creative Commons licenses expire?

Creative Commons licenses expire when the underlying copyright and
similar rights expire.

Note that the relevant rights may expire at different times. For
example, you may have a CC-licensed song where the rights in the musical
arrangement expire before the rights in the lyrics. In this case, when
the copyright in the music expires, you may use it [without being
required to comply with the conditions of the CC
license](#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions "wikilink");
however, you must still comply with the license if you use the lyrics.

#### What happens if the author decides to revoke the CC license to material I am using?

The CC licenses are irrevocable. This means that once you receive
material under a CC license, you will always have the right to use it
under those license terms, even if the licensor changes his or her mind
and stops distributing under the CC license terms. Of course, you may
choose to respect the licensor’s wishes and stop using the work.

#### How can I lose my rights under a Creative Commons license? If that happens, how do I get them back?

All of the CC licenses terminate if you fail to follow the license
conditions. If this happens, you no longer have a license to use the
material.

In the 4.0 licenses, your rights under the license are automatically
reinstated if you correct this failure within 30 days of discovering the
violation (either on your own or because the licensor or someone else
has told you). Under the 3.0 and earlier licenses, there is no automatic
reinstatement.

If you have lost your rights under a CC license and are not entitled to
automatic reinstatement, you may regain your rights under the license if
the licensor expressly grants you permission. You cannot simply
re-download the material to get a new license.

Note that you may still be liable for damages for copyright infringement
for the period where you were not in compliance with the license.

### Technical Questions

<span id="What_is_the_Commons_Deed_What_is_the_legal_code_What_does_the_html.2Fmetadata_do"></span>

#### How do Creative Commons licenses and public domain tools work technically?

The Creative Commons licenses have [three
layers](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/), as does the [CC0 public
domain dedication](https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0): the
human-readable deed, the lawyer-readable legal code, and the
machine-readable metadata. The [Public Domain
Mark](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/) is not legally
operative, and so has only two layers: the human-readable mark and
machine-readable metadata.

When material is licensed using any of the CC licenses or tools, it is
highly recommended that a [CC
button](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads), text, or other
marker somehow accompany it. There are many possible modes for marking.
For our licenses, people generally use the [CC license
chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose) to generate HTML code that
can be pasted into the webpage where the licensed material is published.
CC0 and the Public Domain Mark have a separate
[chooser](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/). Many platforms and
web services such as [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) and
[Drupal](Drupal "wikilink") support CC licensing directly, allowing you
to select an appropriate license. The service then properly marks the
work for you.

CC has published some best practices for
[marking](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license "wikilink") your CC-licensed material, and
recommends:

-   Including a visual indicator (some combination of text and images)
    that the work is licensed with one of the CC licenses.
-   Clearly indicating what material is covered under the CC license,
    especially if it's presented alongside non-licensed materials.
-   Including a link to the human-readable deed (which itself contains a
    link to the legal code).
-   Embedding
    [machine-readable](#what-does-it-mean-that-creative-commons-licenses-are-machine-readable "wikilink")
    metadata in the code of the license indicator or code of the
    licensed page.

**See the [marking](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license "wikilink") page for more
details.**

#### What does it mean that Creative Commons licenses are "machine-readable"?

Creative Commons has [specified CC REL](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC_REL "wikilink") as a way to
associate machine-readable licensing metadata with objects offered under
CC licenses.

Before Creative Commons developed this vocabulary, it was difficult for
a machine to ascertain whether an object was marked with a CC license.
There was also no standard, predictable place to house metadata about
that license (for example, the source URL of the work or the required
mode of attribution).

Machine-readable metadata based on well-accepted metadata standards
creates a platform upon which new services and applications can be
built. Software and services can detect CC licenses and the details of
that license, as described by the metadata. For example, on many
websites and search engines such as Google and Flickr, you can run
filtered searches for works offered under specific CC licenses. In
addition, CC license deeds can automatically create copy-and-paste
attribution code so users may easily comply with the BY condition of the
licenses. When you click on a CC license or
[button](https://creativecommons.org/about/downloads) from a page with
license metadata, you get copy-and-paste attribution HTML within that
license deed page. That HTML is based on available RDFa metadata in the
original material.

All HTML provided by the [CC license
chooser](https://creativecommons.org/choose) is automatically annotated
with [metadata](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/metadata "wikilink") in [RDFa](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/RDFa "wikilink") format.

<span id="Why_did_Creative_Commons_choose_to_use_the_RDF_format_for_its_metadata"></span>

#### What is RDFa?

[RDFa](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/RDFa "wikilink") is a method for embedding structured data in a
web page. For more information about RDFa, see the following resources:

-   [RDFa Primer](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/): Bridging the
    Human and Data Webs
-   [RDFa.info](http://rdfa.info/)
-   [RDFa Wiki](http://rdfa.info/wiki)

<span id="How_can_I_use_Creative_Commons_metadata_in_my_program"></span>

#### What is CC REL and why does Creative Commons recommend it?

[Creative Commons Rights Expression
Language](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_REL) (CC REL) renders
information about licenses and works machine-readable through standards
that define the semantic web. Creative Commons wants to make it easy for
creators and scientists to build upon the works of others when they
choose; licensing your work for reuse and ﬁnding properly licensed works
to reuse should be easy. CC recommends that you mark your licensed works
with CC REL. The Creative Commons license chooser provides HTML
annotated with CC REL, while the Creative Commons deeds recognize CC REL
on web pages with works offered under a CC license, and use this
metadata to enhance the deed for properly marked-up works, e.g., by
providing copy and paste HTML that includes work attribution.

For more background information on CC REL, please refer to this
[paper](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/d/d6/Ccrel-1.0.pdf).

#### What does it mean for a search engine to be CC-enabled?

Some search engines (like
[Google](http://www.google.com/advanced_search?hl=en)) allow people to
filter their search results by usage rights so that you can limit your
search results according to the particular CC license you seek. For
example, if you are looking for a photo to adapt, you can filter your
search to return photos that have a CC license that permits creation of
adaptations. You can generally find this search feature on the advanced
search page of your selected search engine. You can also use [CC
Search](http://search.creativecommons.org), which offers a convenient
interface to search and a list of those content providers that support
searches for content based on usage rights.

Please note, however, that you should always double check to make sure
that the work you locate through a search is licensed as you wish.

<span id="I_want_to_give_users_of_my_site_the_option_to_choose_Creative_Commons_licensing.3B_how_do_I_do_that"></span>
<span id="How_can_I_use_Creative_Commons_metadata_in_my_program"></span>

#### How do I give users of my site the option to use CC licensing like Flickr does?

Creative Commons provides tools for integrating license selection with
your site. You can find an overview at the Web Integration article on
the [CC wiki](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Web_Integration). The
[Partner Interface](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Partner_Interface)
is a good way to get started and will always have the most up-to-date
license versions and translations. However, there is also an
[API](http://api.creativecommons.org/docs/) available if you want more
control.

#### How can I change or remove the Creative Commons search option built into the Firefox browser?

Mozilla has included the Creative Commons search function in many
versions of Firefox along with search options for Google, Amazon, and
other popular sites. Please take a look at the [Firefox article on the
CC wiki](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Firefox_and_CC_Search) for an
explanation of how to change these features.

If you want to add or remove a particular search option, click on the
logo in the search box (for example, the CC logo or the Google logo).
This will open the pull down menu, which will allow you to select
different search providers. If you choose “Manage Search Engines,” you
will be able to add or remove search engines. You can also alter the
order in which the search providers appear on the pull down menu.

#### Is Creative Commons involved in digital rights management (DRM)?

No. CC licenses are a form of rights expression, not rights management.
CC provides tools to make it easier for creators and owners to say which
rights they reserve and permissions they grant. This is different from
digital rights management (or “DRM”), which uses technological
protection measures to prevent people from using the work in a way that
the owner has not permitted.

CC licenses contain language prohibiting licensees from the use of
effective technological measures (including DRM) to prevent access to
licensed material: ”You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
Licensed Rights by any such recipient.”

While licensors may apply effective technological measures (ETMs) to
their own materials, the licensor provides a [limited permission to
circumvent these
measures](#what-if-i-received-cc-licensed-material-encumbered-with-effective-technological-measures-such-as-drm ):
“The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority
to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise
the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to
circumvent Effective Technological Measures.” Note that this only
applies to effective technological measures applied by licensors
themselves: third parties such as distribution platforms may still apply
ETMs if the licensor uploads there, and the license is not able to grant
you permission to circumvent it.

### Legal Background

#### What is copyright and why does it matter?

Copyright law grants exclusive rights to creators of original works of
authorship. National laws usually extend protections to such works
automatically once fixed in a tangible medium, prohibiting the making of
copies without the rights holder’s permission, among other things. On
the internet, even the most basic activities involve making copies of
copyrighted content. As content is increasingly uploaded, downloaded,
and shared online, copyright law is becoming more relevant to more
people than it was 20 years ago. Unfortunately, infringing
copyrights—even unintentionally or unknowingly—can lead to liability.
Successful navigation of the internet requires some understanding of
copyright law.

#### What is the public domain?

The public domain of copyright refers to the aggregate of those works
that are not restricted by copyright within a given jurisdiction. A work
may be part of the public domain because the applicable term of
copyright has expired, because the rights holder surrendered copyright
in the work with a tool like
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0), or because the work did not
meet the applicable standards for copyrightability.

Because the public domain depends on the copyright laws in force within
a particular territory, sometimes a work may be considered “in the
public domain” of one jurisdiction, but not in another. For example,
[U.S. government works are automatically in the public domain under U.S.
copyright law](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#105), but
might be restricted by copyright in other countries.

The [Public Domain Manifesto](http://publicdomainmanifesto.org/), the
[University
Libraries](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter8/Stanford)
page, and the [CC0 FAQs](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ) all
contain additional information about the public domain.

<span id="Do_I_need_to_register_my_copyright"></span>
<span id="How_do_I_register_my_copyright"></span>

#### What do I need to do to get a copyright?

Copyright in most jurisdictions attaches automatically without need for
any formality once a creative work is fixed in tangible form (i.e. the
minute you put pen to paper, take a photo, or hit the “save” button on
your computer).

In some jurisdictions, creators may be required to register with a
national agency in order to enforce copyright in court. If you would
like more information, please consult the [Berne
Convention](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/trtdocs_wo001.html)
or [your jurisdiction's copyright law](http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/).

Although you do not have to apply a copyright notice for your work to be
protected, it may be a useful tool to clearly signal to people that the
work is yours. It also tells the public who to contact about the work.

<span id="What_is_a_derivative_work"></span>

#### What is an adaptation?

An adaptation is a work based on one or more pre-existing works. What
constitutes an adaptation depends on applicable law, however translating
a work from one language to another or creating a film version of a
novel are generally considered adaptations.

In order for an adaptation to be protected by copyright, most national
laws require the creator of the adaptation to add original expression to
the pre-existing work. However, there is no international standard for
originality, and the definition differs depending on the jurisdiction.
Civil law jurisdictions (such as
[Germany](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/legislation/profile/DE) and
[France](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/cpialtext.htm))
tend to require that the work contain an imprint of the adapter's
personality. Common law jurisdictions (such as the
[U.S.](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103) or
[Canada](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-42/index.html)), on the other
hand, tend to have a lower threshold for originality, requiring only a
minimal level of creativity and “independent conception.” Some countries
approach originality completely differently. For example,
[Brazil's](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/legislation/profile/BR)
copyright code protects all works of the mind that do not fall within
the list of works that are expressly defined in the statue as
“unprotected works.” Consult [your jurisdiction's copyright
law](http://www.wipo.int/clea/en/) for more information.

<span id="What_are_moral_rights.2C_and_how_could_I_exercise_them_to_prevent_uses_of_my_work_that_I_don.E2.80.99t_like"></span>

#### What are moral rights?

Copyright laws in many jurisdictions around the world grant creators
“moral rights” in addition to the economic or commercial right to
exploit their creative works. Moral rights protect the personal and
reputational value of a work for its creator. Moral rights differ by
country, and can include the right of attribution, the right to have a
work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and/or the right to the
integrity of the work. The moral right of integrity may provide creators
with a source for redress if an adaptation represents derogatory
treatment of their work, typically defined as “distortion or mutilation”
of the work or treatment that is “prejudicial to the honor, or
reputation of the author.” Not all jurisdictions provide for moral
rights.

The CC licenses are intended to minimize the effect of moral rights on a
licensee’s ability to use licensed material; however, in some
jurisdictions, these rights may still have an effect. CC offers some
additional information on [how CC licenses may affect your moral
rights](#how-do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-my-moral-rights-if-at-all "wikilink").

#### What are neighboring rights?

Copyright provides an incentive to create works by providing exclusive
rights to creators. However, the distribution or exploitation of a work
often involves more than just the creator. For example, if someone
writes a song, someone else may perform the song, and another may
produce the recording of the song. Some jurisdictions extend copyright
to the contributions made by these persons; other jurisdictions extend
such exclusive rights in the form of neighboring rights. Neighboring
rights may include performers' rights or broadcasters' rights, among
others. The [Rome
Convention](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/rome/summary_rome.html)
sets forth some guidelines on the scope of neighboring rights. Not all
jurisdictions recognize neighboring rights.

#### What are sui generis database rights?

Sui generis database rights grant qualifying database makers the right
to prohibit the extraction and reuse of a substantial portion of a
database. The rights are granted to database makers that make a
substantial investment of time and resources to create the database. Sui
generis database rights are primarily enacted within the European Union
and a handful of other jurisdictions.

#### What are collecting societies?

[Collecting
societies](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Version_3#International_Harmonization_.E2.80.94_Collecting_Societies)
are copyright management organizations. Some examples of collecting
societies include ASCAP and BMI (United States), BUMA/STEMRA
(Netherlands), PRS (United Kingdom), and APRA (Australia). These
societies license works on behalf of their owners and process royalty
payments from parties using the copyrighted works.

CC offers additional information on [ how collecting societies might
affect your rights and your ability to apply CC licenses to your
work](#Can_I_use_a_Creative_Commons_license_if_I_am_a_member_of_a_collecting_society "wikilink").
CC has several
[pilots](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Collecting_Society_Projects)
underway with collecting societies that have chosen to allow their
members to use CC licenses on a limited basis.

<span id="When_are_publicity_rights_relevant"></span>
<span id="What_are_publicity_and_privacy_rights"></span>

#### What are publicity, personality, and privacy rights?

These terms are used differently in different jurisdictions. Generally
speaking, these rights allow individuals to control the use of their
voice, image, likeness, or other identifiable aspect of their identity,
especially for purposes of commercial exploitation. Similarly, in some
jurisdictions these rights allow people to restrict others' ability to
publish information about them without their permission. Whether and to
what extent these rights exist, and if so, how they are labeled, varies
depending on the jurisdiction.

[Creative Commons licenses have a limited effect on these
rights](#how-are-publicity-privacy-and-personality-rights-affected-when-i-apply-a-cc-license "wikilink")
where the licensor holds them. Where the licensor has publicity,
personality, or privacy rights that may affect your ability to use the
material as the license intends, the licensor agrees to waive or not
assert those rights. However, any such rights not held by the licensor
are not affected and may still affect your desired use of a licensed
work. If you have created a work or wish to use a work that might in
some way implicate these rights, you may need to obtain permission from
the individuals whose rights may be affected.

## Data

*This page supersedes [Databases and Creative
Commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Databases_and_Creative_Commons "wikilink").*

Much of the potential value of data is to society at large — more data
has the potential to facilitate enhanced scientific collaboration and
reproducibility, more efficient markets, increased government and
corporate transparency, and overall to speed discovery and understanding
of solutions to planetary and societal needs.

A big part of the potential value of data, in particular its
society-wide value, is realized by use across organizational boundaries.
How does this occur legally? Many sites give narrow permission to use
data via terms of service. Much ad hoc data sharing also occurs among
researchers. And increasingly, sharing of data is facilitated by
distribution under standard, public legal tools used to manage copyright
and similar restrictions that might otherwise limit dissemination or
reuse of data, e.g. [CC licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)
or the [CC0](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0 ) public domain dedication.

Many organizations, institutions, and governments are using CC tools for
data. For case studies about how these tools are applied, see:

:   [Uses of CC Licenses with Data and
    Databases](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data_and_CC_licenses "wikilink")
:   [Uses of CC0 with Data and Databases](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_use_for_data "wikilink")

### Frequently asked questions about data and CC licenses

#### Can databases be released under CC licenses?

Yes, [CC licenses can be used to license
databases](#can-i-apply-a-creative-commons-license-to-databases "wikilink").
The most recent version (4.0) may be used to license databases subject
to copyright and, where applicable, sui generis database rights. Sui
generis database rights prevent copying and reusing of [substantial
parts](#what-constitutes-a-substantial-portion-of-a-database "wikilink")
of a database (including frequent extraction of insubstantial parts).
However unlike copyright, database rights protect the maker's
investment, not originality.

CC does not recommend use of its NonCommercial (NC) or NoDerivatives
(ND) licenses on databases intended for scholarly or scientific use.

In addition to our licenses, the [CC0 Public Domain
Dedication](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ "wikilink") may be used on databases to maximize
reuse of databases. When applied, the effect is to waive all copyright
and related rights in the database and its contents, placing it as close
as possible into the worldwide public domain. In certain domains, such
as science and government, there are important reasons to consider using
CC0. Waiving copyright and related rights eliminates all uncertainty for
potential users, encouraging maximal reuse and sharing of information.

#### When a CC license is applied to a database, what is being licensed?

The license terms and conditions apply to the database structure (its
selection and arrangement, [to the extent
copyrightable](#which-components-of-databases-are-protected-by-copyright "wikilink")),
its contents (if copyrightable), and in those instances where the
database maker has [sui generis database
rights](#which-components-of-a-database-are-protected-by-sui-generis-database-rights "wikilink")
then the rights that are granted those makers. Notwithstanding,
licensors can choose to license some rather than all of the rights they
have in a database. Creative Commons advises against this practice.
However, if a licensor chooses to do so anyway, we strongly encourage
licensors to clearly demarcate what is and is not licensed. See
[below](#how-do-i-apply-a-cc-legal-tool-to-a-database "wikilink")
for more information regarding how to provide clear notice of what is
licensed.

#### How do I apply a CC legal tool to a database?

Before making a database available under a CC license, a database
provider should first make sure she has all rights necessary to do so.
Often, the database provider is not the original author of the database
contents. If that is the case, the database provider should secure
separate permission from the other author(s) before publishing the
database under a CC legal tool. If a database maker decides to license
the database without securing permission from the author(s) of the
database contents, it should clearly indicate the material for which
permission has not been secured and clearly mark the material as not
being offered under the terms of the license. For more information, read
our
[pre-licensing](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees "wikilink")
guidelines.

Database providers should also consider carefully what elements of the
database she wants covered by the CC legal tool and identify those
elements in a manner that reusers will see and understand. Please see
our [marking page]https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license "wikilink") for
more information on how to clearly distinguish unlicensed content.

#### How do the different CC license elements operate for a CC-licensed database?

Under version 4.0, if an NC license has been applied then any use of the
licensed database or its contents [that is restricted by copyright
law](#how-do-i-know-whether-a-particular-use-of-a-database-is-restricted-by-copyright "wikilink")
or [sui generis database
rights](#how-do-i-know-whether-a-particular-use-of-a-database-is-restricted-by-sui-generis-database-rights "wikilink")
requires compliance with the [NC
term](#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses "wikilink"),
even if the database is not publicly shared. The other license elements
(BY, ND, and SA, as applicable) must be complied with only if your use
is so restricted and public sharing is involved. Learn more about how to
comply when [your use implicates
copyright](#if-my-use-of-a-database-is-restricted-by-sui-generis-database-rights-how-do-i-comply-with-the-license "wikilink")
and/or [sui generis database
rights](#if-my-use-of-a-database-is-restricted-by-sui-generis-database-rights-how-do-i-comply-with-the-license "wikilink").

Prior CC license versions do not require compliance with the license
restrictions or conditions when only sui generis database rights (and
not copyright) are implicated. Please see below for more detail about
[how this works in the
current](#if-my-use-of-a-database-is-restricted-by-sui-generis-database-rights-how-do-i-comply-with-the-license "wikilink")
and [prior
versions](#how-does-the-treatment-of-sui-generis-database-rights-vary-in-prior-versions-of-cc-licenses "wikilink")
of the licenses.

#### Can I conduct text/data mining on a CC-licensed database?

Yes. However, you should be aware that whether you have to comply with
the CC license terms and conditions will depend on whether the type of
mining activity you conduct implicates copyright or any applicable sui
generis database rights. If you are not exercising an exclusive right
held by the database maker, then you do not need to rely on the license
to mine. Because there are many different methods for conducting text
and data mining, however, there may be some types of mining activities
that will implicate the licensed rights.

***If and only if your particular use is one that would require
permission***, you should note the following:

-   *Permission:* All six of the 4.0 licenses allow for text and data
    mining by granting express permission to privately reproduce,
    extract, and reuse the contents of a licensed database and create
    adapted databases.
-   *Commercial purposes:* If you are conducting text and data mining
    for [commercial
    purposes](#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses ),
    you should not mine NC-licensed databases or other material.
-   *Outputs:* If you publicly share the results of your mining activity
    or the data you mined, you should attribute the rights holder. If
    what you publicly share qualifies as an adaptation of the licensed
    material, you should not mine ND-licensed material. If you share an
    adaptation of material under an SA license, you must apply the same
    license to the adaptation that results.

[If your use is not one that requires permission under the
license](#do-i-always-have-to-comply-with-the-license-terms-if-not-what-are-the-exceptions ),
you may conduct text and data mining activity without regard to the
above considerations.

#### How does the treatment of sui generis database rights vary in prior versions of CC licenses?

As explained
[above](#can-databases-be-released-under-cc-licenses "wikilink"),
the current version of the CC license suite (4.0) licenses sui generis
database rights in addition to copyright and other closely related
rights. Past versions of CC licenses operate differently with respect to
sui generis database rights.

In the CC version 3.0 licenses, the legal treatment of sui generis
database rights varies, but the practical result is always the same:
compliance with the license restrictions and conditions is not required
where sui generis database rights--but not copyright--are implicated.
This means that if someone extracts a substantial portion of a
CC-licensed database and uses it in a way that does not implicate
copyright (e.g., by rearranging purely factual data), the license does
not require her to attribute the licensor or comply with any other
restrictions or conditions, even if the database is protected by sui
generis database rights.

While this result is the same across all CC version 3.0 licenses, the
reason for this outcome varies. In the 3.0 licenses ported to the laws
of EU jurisdictions, the scope of the licenses expressly cover databases
subject to copyright and/or sui generis database rights. However, the
conditions of the license are explicitly waived when use of the licensed
work only involves the exercise of database rights.

By contrast, the 3.0 unported licenses and all other ported licenses do
not expressly license sui generis database rights. As a result, those
licenses do not apply when sui generis database rights alone are
implicated. This means a licensee may need separate permission to use
the database in a way that implicates sui generis database rights
(although arguably an implied license to exercise those rights may be
deemed granted in some jurisdictions).

More information on the underlying 3.0 policy decision the treatment of
sui generis database rights those licenses can be found [on our wiki
(.pdf)](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/4.0/Sui_generis_database_rights).

#### What is the difference between the Open Data Commons licenses and the CC 4.0 licenses?

The [Open Database License
(ODbL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/) and the [Open
Data Commons Attribution License
(ODC-BY)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/) are licenses
designed specifically for use on databases and not on other types of
material. There are many differences between those licenses and CC
licenses, but the most important to be aware of relate to license scope
and operation. The ODC licenses apply only to sui generis database
rights and any copyright in the database structure, they do not apply to
the individual contents of the database. The latest version of the CC
licenses on the other hand apply to sui generis database rights and all
copyright and neighboring rights in the database structure as well as
the contents. (See
[above](#how-does-the-treatment-of-sui-generis-database-rights-vary-in-prior-versions-of-cc-licenses "wikilink")
for more detail about how past versions of CC licenses vary with respect
to sui generis database rights.)

Another important difference is that ODC licenses may create contractual
obligations even in jurisdictions where database rights would not
otherwise exist and but for the license permission would not be
necessary. CC has crafted its licenses to ensure that they [never impose
obligations where permission is not otherwise
required](#how-do-cc-licenses-operate )
to use the licensed material.

### Frequently asked questions about data, generally

#### Which components of databases are protected by copyright?

With databases, there are likely four components to consider: (1) the
database model or structure, (2) the data entry and output sheet, (3)
field names, and (4) the data or other content.

The **database model** refers to how a database is structured and
organized, including database tables and table indexes. The selection,
coordination, and arrangement of the database is subject to copyright if
it is sufficiently original. The originality threshold is fairly low in
many jurisdictions. For example, while courts in the United States have
held that an alphabetical telephone directory was insufficiently
original to merit copyright protection, an organized directory of
Chinese-American businesses in a particular area did.[^1] These
determinations are very fact-specific (no pun intended) and vary by
jurisdiction.

The **data entry and output sheets** contain questions, and the answers
to these questions are stored in a database. For example, a web page
asking a scientist to enter a gene’s name, its pathway information, and
its ontology would constitute a data entry sheet. The format and layout
of these sheets are protected by copyright according to the same
standard of originality used to determine if the database model is
copyrightable.

**Field names** describe the contents or data. For example, “address”
might be the name of the field for street address information. These are
less likely to be protected by copyright because they often lack
sufficient originality.

The **data** or other contents contained in the database are subject to
copyright if they are sufficiently creative. Original poems contained in
a database would be protected by copyright, but purely factual data
(such as gene names or city populations) would not. Facts are not
subject to copyright, nor are the ideas underlying copyrighted content.

#### How do I know whether a particular use of a database is restricted by copyright?

When the database structure or its contents is subject to copyright,
reproducing, distributing, or modifying the database will often be
restricted by copyright law. However, it is important to note that some
uses of a copyrighted database will not be restricted by copyright. It
may be possible, for example, to rearrange or modify the uncopyrightable
data in a way that does not implicate the copyright in the database
structure. For example, while (as noted above) a court in the United
States held that a directory of Chinese-American businesses was
restricted by copyright, the same court went on to hold that a directory
that duplicated hundreds of its listings was not infringing because the
listings were categorized and arranged in a sufficiently dissimilar way.
In those situations, compliance with the license conditions is not
required unless the database contents are themselves restricted by
copyright.

Similarly, even where database contents are subject to copyright and
published under a CC license, use of the facts and ideas embedded within
the contents will not require attribution (or compliance with other
applicable license conditions), unless doing so implicates copyright in
the database structure as explained above. This [important limitation of
all CC
licenses](#how-do-cc-licenses-operate )
is highlighted on the license deeds in the Notice section, where we
emphasize that compliance with the license is not required for elements
of the material in the public domain.

#### If my use of a database is restricted by copyright, how do I comply with the license?

All CC licenses require that you attribute the licensor when your use
involves public sharing. Your other obligations depend on the particular
CC license applied to the database. If it is a NC license, any regulated
use must be limited to [noncommercial
purposes](#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses "wikilink")
only. If a ND is applied, you may produce an adapted database but cannot
share it publicly. If it is a ShareAlike (SA) license, you must apply
the same or a [compatible
license](#if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use "wikilink")
to any adaptation of the database you share publicly.

<span id="What_are_sui_generis_database_rights"></span>

#### Which components of a database are protected by sui generis database rights?

In contrast to copyright, sui generis database rights are designed to
protect a maker's substantial investment in a database. In particular,
the right prevents the unauthorized extraction and reuse of a
[substantial
portion](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data#What_constitutes_a_.E2.80.9Csubstantial_portion.E2.80.9D_of_a_database.3F "wikilink")
of the contents.

#### How do I know whether a particular use of a database is restricted by sui generis database rights?

When a database is subject to sui generis database rights, extracting
and reusing a [substantial
portion](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data#What_constitutes_a_.E2.80.9Csubstantial_portion.E2.80.9D_of_a_database.3F "wikilink")
of the database contents is prohibited absent some express exception.

**It is important to remember that sui generis database rights exist in
only a few countries outside the [European
Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive#Implementation),
such as Korea and Mexico. Generally, if you are using a CC-licensed
database in a location where those rights do not exist, you do not have
to comply with license restrictions or conditions unless copyright (or
some other licensed right) is implicated.**

Note that if you are using a database in a jurisdiction where you must
respect database rights, and you receive a CC-licensed work from someone
located in a jurisdiction without database rights, you should determine
whether database rights exist and have been licensed. If so, you need to
properly mark and attribute as the license requires, since the person
from whom you received the database may not have been required to keep
that information. If you are using a licensed database and you do not
have to comply with the license terms because such rights do not exist
in your jurisdiction, we recommend that you retain this information
where possible. Doing so assists downstream reusers who are required to
provide it when they share further.

#### What constitutes a “substantial portion” of a database?

There is no bright line test for what constitutes a “substantial
portion”. The answer will depend on the law in the relevant
jurisdiction. Note that what constitutes a substantial portion is
determined both quantitatively and qualitatively. Also, using several
insubstantial portions can add up to a substantial portion.

<span id="How_(if_at_all)_are_sui_generis_database_rights_addressed_in_CC_licenses'"></span>

#### If my use of a database is restricted by sui generis database rights, how do I comply with the license?

If the database is released under the current version (4.0) of CC
licenses, you must attribute the licensor if you share a [substantial
portion](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Data#What_constitutes_a_.E2.80.9Csubstantial_portion.E2.80.9D_of_a_database.3F "wikilink")
of the database contents. The other requirements depend on the
particular license applied to the database. Under the NC licenses, you
may not extract and reuse a substantial portion of the database contents
for [commercial
purposes](#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses).
The ND licenses prohibit you from including a substantial portion of the
database contents in another publicly shared database in which you have
sui generis database rights of your own. And finally, the SA licenses
require you to apply the same or a [compatible
license](#if-i-derive-or-adapt-material-offered-under-a-creative-commons-license-which-cc-licenses-can-i-use "wikilink")
to any database you share publicly and in which you include a
substantial portion of the licensed database contents. Note that this
does **not** require you to ShareAlike any copyright or other rights you
have in the individual contents of the database.

## Artificial intelligence and CC licenses

#### What are the limits on how CC-licensed works can be used in the development of new technologies, such as training of artificial intelligence software?

The licenses grant permission for reuse in any situation that requires
permission under copyright. There are many ways in which CC-licensed work works
and even all rights reserved works can be reused without permission. This
includes [uses that are fair
uses](#do-creative-commons-licenses-affect-exceptions-and-limitations-to-copyright-such-as-fair-dealing-and-fair-use),
for example.

If someone uses a CC-licensed work with any new or developing technology, and
if copyright permission is required, then the CC license allows that use
without the need to seek permission from the copyright owner so long as the
license conditions are respected. This is one of the enduring qualities of our
licenses — they have been carefully designed to work with all new technologies
where copyright comes into play. No special or explicit permission regarding
new technologies from a copyright perspective is required.

#### But what about privacy laws, rules governing ethical research, and data protection laws?

CC’s copyright licenses are not universal policy tools. Copyright is the
primary obstacle to reuse that our licenses solve, but there are many other
issues related to the reuse of content that our licenses do not address and
that reusers should be aware of. These can include
[privacy](#how-are-publicity-privacy-and-personality-rights-affected-when-i-apply-a-cc-license)
and rules governing ethical research and the collection or use of data, which
have to be addressed and respected separate and apart from the copyright issues
that CC licenses cover.

#### What attribution obligations exist when CC-licensed images are included in a published dataset? Is linking to the original image or URI required, and if so, is it adequate?

It depends. First, keep in mind that CC licenses never limit uses that
copyright doesn’t control. For example, as a general matter text and data
mining in the United States is considered a fair use and does not require
permission under copyright. This means that reusers engaged in text and data
mining do not have to adhere to the marking and attribution requirements in our
licenses for that activity even though we strongly recommend they do so anyway.
A second example is linking. In some countries, linking to copyrighted content
doesn’t require permission under copyright law, which means the CC license
obligations do not come into play even though the linked content is
CC-licensed.

Where a CC-licensed work is distributed as part of a database or dataset, and
assuming copyright (or in the European Union, copyright or sui generis database
rights) is triggered, then the license conditions must be respected. This means
providing the required attribution information in a way that is reasonable
under the circumstances. Our licenses allow for some flexibility, and in some
cases that may be as simple as providing a link to the website where the
relevant attribution information is provided. Visit our [marking
practices](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution)
page for more information.

#### If a for-profit company uses CC-licensed content under a Non Commercial license and releases the work under terms that allow only research purposes, is the NC restriction violated?

This depends on whether any of the uses made of the works by the company,
whether for profit or non profit, are primarily intended for commercial
advantage or monetary compensation. This is hard to know without having all of
the facts about how a work was used, whether internally by the company for its
own purposes or how the work was distributed for further use. Visit our [NC
page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/NonCommercial_interpretation) for
more information about what constitutes commercial and non commercial uses of
works.

If NC-licensed content is redistributed to the public under an NC license, that
distribution would not violate the NC clause. (Note that CC strongly
discourages the use of any license terms other than a CC NC license for
redistributions of NC-licensed content.)

#### If CC SA-licensed content is included in a database, does the entire database have to be licensed under an SA license?

CC licenses never require a reuser of a CC-licensed work to make the original
work or resulting works (collections, derivatives, etc.) publicly available.
There are lots of private reuses of works that are permitted by CC's licenses
that do not require compliance with their terms. Regarding ShareAlike, the
condition only applies if a work is modified and if the work is shared
publicly. In the situation where a reuser created a dataset of photos and made
it publicly available, and assuming copyright permission is required, then what
is released is likely a collection or compilation of pre-existing works. CC
licenses do not require the collection or the compilation itself to be made
available under an SA license, even though each individual work is still
licensed individually under an SA license and if they were modified by the
distributor the modified photo would need to be licensed under the same terms.
For example, were Creative Commons to compile photographs from a photo sharing
website under a BY-SA 2.0 license and create a database that it then publicly
distributed, CC could license the collection as a whole under a BY license, but
the photographs would continue to be licensed under BY-SA 2.0.

#### What, if any, remedies, do users have if they dislike how their photos or images have been reused?

Several remedies are potentially available. Some may be available if the CC
license terms have been violated, and others may be available through other,
separate avenues because they involve other laws or regulations that the CC
licenses do not cover. It’s important to remember, however, that absent a
violation of the license the permissions granted under the [license remain in
place and cannot be
revoked](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors).

* Under the CC licenses, even if a license condition has not been violated licensors can ask that attribution to them be removed so they can distance themselves from the reuse.
* For violations of a CC license term where the license was required (not a fair use, etc.) then you may have a claim for copyright infringement. Fortunately, in the CC community most license violations are handled amicably without resorting to the courts.
* For claims involving laws and regulations other than copyright, recourse may be available depending on your local laws.

An important starting point for any would-be sharer of content under a CC
license is to educate yourself in advance about how they work and what rights
they do and do not cover. We have many [FAQs](https://creativecommons.org/faq/)
on our website. We also provide [human-readable
deeds](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with links to the [full
text of our licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode).
Additionally, all of our licenses highlight at the beginning many
[considerations that
licensors](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors)
should have in mind before they license, and considerations for [reusers of
works](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees)
before they do so in order to avoid inadvertent violations.
